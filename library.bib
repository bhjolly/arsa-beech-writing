@article{Heenan2013,
abstract = {The generic taxonomy of the Nothofagaceae is revised. We present a new phylogenetic analysis of morphological characters and map these characters onto a recently published phylogenetic tree obtained from DNA sequence data. Results of these and previous analyses strongly support the monophyly of four clades of Nothofagaceae that are currently treated as subgenera of Nothofagus. The four clades of Nothofagaceae are robust and well-supported, with deep stem divergences, have evolutionary equivalence with other genera of Fagales, and can be circumscribed with morphological characters. We argue that these morphological and molecular differences are sufficient for the four clades of Nothofagaceae to be recognised at the primary rank of genus, and that this classification will be more informative and efficient than the currently circumscribed Nothofagus with four subgenera. Nothofagus is recircumscribed to include five species from southern South America, Lophozonia and Trisyngyne are reinstated, and the new genus Fuscospora is described. Fuscospora and Lophozonia, with six and seven species respectively, occur in New Zealand, southern South America and Australia. Trisyngyne comprises 25 species from New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. New combinations are provided where necessary in each of these genera. {\textcopyright} 2013 Magnolia Press.},

@article{King2011,
abstract = {The stoat (Mustela erminea) is a specialist predator that evolved to exploit the unstable populations of northern voles and lemmings. It was introduced to New Zealand, where it is pre-adapted to respond with a population irruption to the resource pulses that follow a heavy seedfall of southern beech (Nothofagus spp.). Culling stoats during an irruption is necessary to reduce damaging predation on nesting endemic birds. Culling might not reduce the stoat population long term, however, if high natural mortality exceeds culling mortality in peak years. During other phases of the beech-mast cycle, culling might have a greater effect on a smaller stoat population, whether or not damage prevention is critical. We developed a 4-matrix model to predict the effects of culling on $\lambda$, the annual rate of change in the size of the stoat population, through the four annual phases of an average masting cycle, explicitly distinguishing between apparent and real culling. In the Post-seedfall phase of the cycle, large numbers of stoats are killed, but little of this extra mortality is additive; in other phases, culling removes larger proportions of smaller total numbers of stoats that would otherwise have lived. Culling throughout all phases is most effective at reducing stoat populations, but is also the most expensive option. Culling in Post-seedfall plus Seed or Crash years is somewhat less effective but better than culling in one phase only. Culling has different short-term effects on stoat age distribution depending on the phase of the cycle when culling begins. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Data management is growing in complexity as large-scale applications take advantage of the loosely coupled resources brought together by grid middleware and by abundant storage capacity. Metadata describing the data products used in and generated by these applications is essential to disambiguate the data and enable reuse. Data provenance, one kind of metadata, pertains to the derivation history of a data product starting from its original sources. The provenance of data products generated by complex transformations such as workflows is of considerable value to scientists. From it, one can ascertain the quality of the data based on its ancestral data and derivations, track back sources of errors, allow automated re-enactment of derivations to update a data, and provide attribution of data sources. Provenance is also essential to the business domain where it can be used to drill down to the source of data in a data warehouse, track the creation of intellectual property, and provide an audit trail for regulatory purposes. In this paper we create a taxonomy of data provenance techniques, and apply the classification to current research efforts in the field. The main aspect of our taxonomy categorizes provenance systems based on why they record provenance, what they describe, how they represent and store provenance, and ways to disseminate it. Our synthesis can help those building scientific and business metadata-management systems to understand existing provenance system designs. The survey culminates with an identification of open research problems in the field.},

abstract = {Provenance is information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing, which can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness. PROV-DM is the conceptual data model that forms a basis for the W3C provenance (PROV) family of specifications. PROV-DM distinguishes core structures, forming the essence of provenance information, from extended structures catering for more specific uses of provenance. PROV-DM is organized in six components, respectively dealing with: (1) entities and activities, and the time at which they were created, used, or ended; (2) derivations of entities from entities; (3) agents bearing responsibility for entities that were generated and activities that happened; (4) a notion of bundle, a mechanism to support provenance of provenance; (5) properties to link entities that refer to the same thing; and, (6) collections forming a logical structure for its members. This document introduces the provenance concepts found in PROV and defines PROV-DM types and relations. The PROV data model is domain-agnostic, but is equipped with extensibility points allowing domain-specific information to be included. Two further documents complete the specification of PROV-DM. First, a companion document specifies the set of constraints that provenance should follow. Second, a separate document describes a provenance notation for expressing instances of provenance for human consumption; this notation is used in examples in this document.},

@article{Ney2013,
abstract = {Conducting experiments and documenting results is daily business of scientists. Good and traceable documentation enables other scientists to confirm procedures and results for increased credibility. Documentation and scientific conduct are regulated and termed as good laboratory practice. Laboratory notebooks are used to record each step in conducting an experiment and processing data. Originally, these notebooks were paper based. Due to computerised research systems, acquired data became more elaborate, thus increasing the need for electronic notebooks with data storage, computational features and reliable electronic documentation. As a new approach to this, a scientific data management system (DataFinder) is enhanced with features for traceable documentation. Provenance recording is used to meet requirements of traceability, and this information can later be queried for further analysis. DataFinder has further important features for scientific documentation: It employs a heterogeneous and distributed data storage concept. This enables access to different types of data storage systems (e. g. Grid data infrastructure, file servers). In this chapter we describe a number of building blocks that are available or close to finished development. These components are intended for assembling an electronic laboratory notebook for use in Grid environments, while retaining maximal flexibility on usage scenarios as well as maximal compatibility overlap towards each other. Through the usage of such a system, provenance can successfully be used to trace the scientific workflow of preparation, execution, evaluation, interpretation and archiving of research data. The reliability of research results increases and the research process remains transparent to remote research partners. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

Why do Wikipedia articles vary widely in quality? We investigate the relationship between collaboration and Wikipedia article quality.

Based on an empirical study, we classify contributors based on their roles in editing individual Wikipedia articles. We identify various patterns of collaboration based on the provenance or, more specifically, who does what to Wikipedia articles.

abstract = {In many application areas like e-science and data-warehousing detailed information about the origin of data is required. This kind of information is often re- ferred to as data provenance or data lineage. The provenance of a data item includes information about the processes and source data items that lead to its creation and current representation. The diversity of data representation models and application domains has lead to a number of more or less formal definitions of provenance. Most of them are limited to a special application domain, data representation model or data processing facility. Not surprisingly, the associated implementations are also restricted to some application domain and depend on a special data model. In this paper we give a survey of data provenance models and prototypes, present a general categorization scheme for provenance models and use this categorization scheme to study the proper- ties of the existing approaches. This categorization enables us to distinguish between different kinds of provenance information and could lead to a better understanding of provenance in general. Besides the categorization of provenance types, it is important to include the storage, transformation and query requirements for the different kinds of provenance information and application domains in our considerations. The analysis of existing approaches will assist us in revealing open research problems in the area of data provenance.},

abstract = {The quality of Wikipedia articles is debatable. On the one hand, existing research indicates that not only are people willing to contribute articles but the quality of these articles is close to that found in conventional encyclopedias. On the other hand, the public has never stopped criticizing the quality of Wikipedia articles, and critics never have trouble finding low-quality Wikipedia articles. Why do Wikipedia articles vary widely in quality? We investigate the relationship between collaboration and Wikipedia article quality. We show that the quality of Wikipedia articles is not only dependent on the different types of contributors but also on how they collaborate. Based on an empirical study, we classify contributors based on their roles in editing individual Wikipedia articles. We identify various patterns of collaboration based on the provenance or, more specifically, who does what to Wikipedia articles. Our research helps identify collaboration patterns that are preferable or detrimental for article quality, thus providing insights for designing tools and mechanisms to improve the quality of Wikipedia articles.},

abstract = {In many application areas like e-science and data-warehousing detailed information about the origin of data is required. This kind of information is often re- ferred to as data provenance or data lineage. The provenance of a data item includes information about the processes and source data items that lead to its creation and current representation. The diversity of data representation models and application domains has lead to a number of more or less formal definitions of provenance. Most of them are limited to a special application domain, data representation model or data processing facility. Not surprisingly, the associated implementations are also restricted to some application domain and depend on a special data model. In this paper we give a survey of data provenance models and prototypes, present a general categorization scheme for provenance models and use this categorization scheme to study the proper- ties of the existing approaches. This categorization enables us to distinguish between different kinds of provenance information and could lead to a better understanding of provenance in general. Besides the categorization of provenance types, it is important to include the storage, transformation and query requirements for the different kinds of provenance information and application domains in our considerations. The analysis of existing approaches will assist us in revealing open research problems in the area of data provenance.},

abstract = {Data management is growing in complexity as large-scale applications take advantage of the loosely coupled resources brought together by grid middleware and by abundant storage capacity. Metadata describing the data products used in and generated by these applications is essential to disambiguate the data and enable reuse. Data provenance, one kind of metadata, pertains to the derivation history of a data product starting from its original sources. The provenance of data products generated by complex transformations such as workflows is of considerable value to scientists. From it, one can ascertain the quality of the data based on its ancestral data and derivations, track back sources of errors, allow automated re-enactment of derivations to update a data, and provide attribution of data sources. Provenance is also essential to the business domain where it can be used to drill down to the source of data in a data warehouse, track the creation of intellectual property, and provide an audit trail for regulatory purposes. In this paper we create a taxonomy of data provenance techniques, and apply the classification to current research efforts in the field. The main aspect of our taxonomy categorizes provenance systems based on why they record provenance, what they describe, how they represent and store provenance, and ways to disseminate it. Our synthesis can help those building scientific and business metadata-management systems to understand existing provenance system designs. The survey culminates with an identification of open research problems in the field.},

Remotely sensed imagery, if appropriately interpreted, can provide detailed, quantitative data for deriving forest information. This paper describes the tree identification and delineation algorithm (TIDA), an image analysis tool designed to delineate tree crowns automatically in high spatial resolution digital imagery. The (local) radiometric maxima and minima are the primary image features used for the crown delineation process, being indicative of crown centroids and boundaries, respectively. TIDA was developed for application to imagery of native Eucalypt forests in Australia, and uses a 'top-down' spatial clustering approach involving key steps designed to reduce the effects of crown segmentation. The assumptions and fundamental processes of the algorithm are described, examples of the output and performance considerations are given, and possible limitations are discussed. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Monitoring vegetation using remote sensing is beset with difficulties. Primary among these are the variations of vegetation reflectance with sun zenith angle, view zenith angle, and terrain slope angle. To provide corrections of these effects, for visible and near-infrared. light, we derive two simple physicial models of vegetation reflectance, both of which have three parameters. The first model, WAK I, is applicable when illumination is by direct light only; and the second model, WAK II, is applicable when illumination is by both diffuse and direct light. The models were tested by fitting them to reflectance data of Virginia pine, irrigated wheat, and alfalfa, at large sun zenith angles, and then comparing predictions of reflectance at small sun zenith angles with measurements. The process was then reversed to do the fitting on the small sun zenith measurements and the prediction of the large sun zenith measurements. Using this method of assessment, the WAK models were found to perform better than several other published models. The WAK models were used to derive a formula for the variation of reflectance with terrain slope angle, which was tested by measuring reflectances of microcanopies set up on different slopes in the laboratory. The formula permits topographic correction of vegetation reflectance without needing to know the bidirectional reflectance factor. The simplicity and robustness of the WAK models make them useful for general correction and calibration of remotely sensed imagery. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many studies predict effects of future climate scenarios on species distribu- tions, but few predict impacts on landscapes or ecological communities, the scales most relevant to conservation management. We combined expert knowledge with community- level spatial modelling (using artificial neural networks, ANN, and generalised dissimi- larity modelling, GDM) to inform climate adaptation management in widespread but highly threatened temperate grassy ecosystems (TGE) of Australian agricultural land- scapes. GDM predicted high levels of ‘biotically-scaled environmental stress' (scaled in terms of potential change in species composition of communities) for plants, reptiles and snails within the TGE under medium, and especially high, 2070 climate scenarios. Pre- dicted stress was lower for birds, mammals and frogs, possibly owing to generally wider species distributions, but these models do not account for changing habitat characteristics. ANN predicted environments within the current TGE biome will become increasingly favourable for formations such as chenopod shrublands, Casuarina L. forests and Callitris Vent. forests by 2070, although classification error for eucalypt woodland in current cli- mates was high. Expert knowledge and GDM suggest these predictions may be mediated by attributes such as environmental heterogeneity that confer resilience, but GDM confirms that widespread degradation has greatly compromised the capacity of TGE to adapt to change. Based on model predictions and expert knowledge we discuss five potential climate change outcomes for TGE: decreasing fire frequency, structural change, altered functional composition, exotic invasion, and cascading changes in ecological interactions. Although significant ecological change in TGE is likely, it is feasible to ameliorate non- climatic limits to adaptation and promote reassembly by native rather than exotic species. Current conservation efforts already target similar goals, and reinforcing and adjusting these approaches offer the highest priority, lowest risk climate adaptation options. We conclude that despite high uncertainties, combining community-level modelling with expert knowledge can guide climate adaptation management.},

abstract = {This study describes SNOW-WEB, a distributed system of atmospheric sensors, which is cost-effective and can be efficiently deployed in Antarctica. The system supports traditional atmospheric sensors and has built-in redundancy as many units can be deployed in a relatively small area for a similar cost to one conventional weather station. Furthermore, each unit is equipped with wireless mesh-networking capabilities and so is able to share information with those units in its direct vicinity. This allows for the ferrying of collected information to a manned observation station and hence the ability to monitor data in real-time. GPS hardware installed on each unit also allows for high-resolution glacier or ice shelf tracking. As a testing study, eighteen such weather stations were deployed in the vicinity of Scott Base, Ross Island, Antarctica over the 2011/12 summer season. This paper reports on the successful development and deployment of the system, results from the testing period and challenges encountered during the experiment. Collected data is validated against automatic weather stations already operating in the region and an intercomparison is performed between SNOW-WEB data and forecast output from the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System. A high degree of agreement is found between data sources. We conclude that SNOW-WEB data is suitable for use in studies of mesoscale meteorology. ? Antarctic Science Ltd 2013.},

abstract = {For the past twenty five years the NIH family of imaging software, NIH Image and ImageJ have been pioneers as open tools for scientific image analysis. We discuss the origins, challenges and solutions of these two programs, and how their history can serve to advise and inform other software projects. The last fifty years have seen tremendous technological advances, few greater than in the area of scientific computing. One of the fields where scientific computing has made particular inroads has been in the area of biological imaging. The modern computer coupled to advances in microscopy technology is enabling new frontiers in biology to be visualized. While the role of the optical technologies and methods have been well documented, the role of scientific imaging software and its origins have been seldom discussed in any historical context. This is due in part to the relative youth of the field, the wide variety of imaging software tools available, sheer diversity of sub fields and specialized tools, and the constant creation and evolution of new tools. Yet in this great diversity and change, one software tool has not only survived but thrived. The scientific image analysis program, ImageJ 1, 2 , known in previous incarnations as NIH Image 3 , is an early pioneer in image analysis. Yet 25 years later the program not only persists but continues to push and drive the field. Interestingly, the program has done so not by continuously reinventing itself but instead by sticking to a core set of design principles that have allowed it to become a modern image processing platform and yet retain an interface that a user from over 20 years ago would recognize and readily use. Given the great success and impact of ImageJ one would expect that this application was a software initiative with official backing and formal planning by a central funding body. Despite its original name, NIH image, and its home at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for over 30 years in some form, ImageJ is a product of need and user driven development and collaboration rather than a specific plan by the NIH to create it at the onset.},

abstract = {As a state-of-the-art technology for fine-scale forest investigation, mobile terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR), also referred to as mobile laser scanning (MLS), recently has been increasingly exploited to improve its performance on this task. One potential solution is to apply special MLS systems with the capability of collecting multiple echoes per pulse (multi-echoes, for short) from canopies. The methodologies of this rationale turned out to perform better but still insufficiently for canopy properties retrieval, owing to their common defective premise. That is, the knowledge of the characteristics of MLS scan data comprising multi-echoes, so far, is in shortage, especially when regarding the dynamic process of tree foliation. As a pioneering work for this challenge, this study attempted to comprehensively analyze the characteristics of MLS multi-echoes collected from tree crowns during foliation. Specifically, new stable multi-echoes-related features were deduced under the schematic frame of relative quantification, in both spatial and temporal sense. "Relative" here briefly means the division operation deployed on the attributes of multi-echoes, individually in terms of the number of echoes, echo width and crown volume integrity, between their different return orders. Then, the "relative" schematic was primarily validated for more stably representing crown properties during foliation, based on the real data that was collected by the Sensei MLS system with a maximum of three echoes per pulse. Further, a case of tree species classification was examined using a linear discriminant classifier, and it was testified that the resultant temporal statistical rules of multi-echoes as the reverse clues can enhance the performance of MLS in applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

We focused on forest environments of diverse and layered structure, which were technically characterized by strong occlusion effects with regards to laser scanning. The number and distribution of tree stems are important information for the management of protective forests against natural hazards, for forest inventory, and for ecological studies. Our approach builds upon a three-dimensional (3D) voxel grid transformation of the original point cloud data, followed by two major steps of processing. Firstly, a series of morphological operations removed leaves and branches and left only potential stem segments. Secondly, the stem segments of each tree were combined by a multipart workflow, which uses shape and neighborhood criteria. At the same time, erroneous fragments and noise were removed from the dataset. As a result, each object in the voxel grid was represented by a single connected component referring to one specific tree stem. Testing the method on nine spatially independent plots provided detection rates of 97{\%} for the number and location of stems from mature trees with a diameter 12 cm and 84{\%} for smaller trees with a minimum of 130 cm total tree height. In summary, we obtained a dataset covering the number and locations of the stems from both mature and understory trees, while not aiming at a precise reconstruction of the stem shape.},

abstract = {The application of static terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) in forest inventories is becoming more effective. Nevertheless, the occlusion effect is still limiting the processing efficiency to extract forest attributes. The use of a mobile laser scanner (MLS) would reduce this occlusion. In this study, we assessed and compared a hand-held mobile laser scanner (HMLS) with two TLS approaches (single scan: SS, and multi scan: MS) for the estimation of several forest parameters in a wide range of forest types and structures. We found that SS is competitive to extract the ground surface of forest plots, while MS gives the best result to describe the upper part of the canopy. The whole cross-section at 1.3 m height is scanned for 91{\%} of the trees (DBH {\textgreater} 10 cm) with the HMLS leading to the best results for DBH estimates (bias of −0.08 cm and RMSE of 1.11 cm), compared to no fully-scanned trees for SS and 42{\%} fully-scanned trees for MS. Irregularities, such as bark roughness and non-circular cross-section may explain the negative bias encountered for all of the scanning approaches. The success of using MLS in forests will allow for 3D structure acquisition on a larger scale and in a time-efficient manner.},

abstract = {In this study, individual tree height (TH), crown base height (CBH), crown area (CA) and crown volume (CV), which were considered as essential parameters for individual stem volume and biomass estimation, were estimated by both an airborne laser scanner (ALS) and a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). These ALS- and TLS-derived tree parameters were compared because TLS has been introduced as an instrument to measure objects more precisely. ALS-estimated TH was extracted from the highest value within a crown boundary delineated with the crown height model (CHM). The ALS-derived CBH of individual trees was estimated by k-means clustering method using the ALS data within the boundary. The ALS-derived CA was calculated simply with the crown boundary, after which CV was computed automatically using the crown geometric volume (CGV). On the other hand, all TLS-derived parameters were detected manually and precisely except the TLS-derived CGV. As a result, the ALS-extracted TH, CA, and CGV values were underestimated whereas CBH was overestimated when compared with the TLS-derived parameters. The coefficients of determination (R2) from the regression analysis between the ALS and TLS estimations were approximately 0.94, 0.75, 0.69 and 0.58, and root mean square errors (RMSEs) were approximately 0.0184 m, 0.4929 m, 2.3216 m2 and 13.2087 m3 for TH, CBH, CA and CGV, respectively. Thereby, the error rate decreased to 0.0089, 0.0727 and 0.0875 for TH, CA and CGV via the combination of ALS and TLS data},

abstract = {The observed acceleration of glaciers from West Antarctica into the Amundsen Sea is estimated to be contributing 6{\%} to current sea-level rise with the estimated potential to add 0.24 m to global sea level. Stronger westerly winds over the Amundsen Sea can increase the flow of relatively warm ocean water to the base of ice shelves that flow from glaciers into the Amundsen Sea. Thinning of the glaciers caused by this warming is a potentially important factor in driving the observed acceleration of glaciers. However, the climatology of winds in the region has not been extensively studied due to a lack of in situ observational long-term records. Here six different reanalysis datasets are assessed ({\{}CFSR{\}}, {\{}ERA-40{\}}, {\{}ERA-Interim{\}}, {\{}JRA-25{\}}, {\{}MERRA{\}} and {\{}NNR1){\}} to determine a best estimate of variability and change since 1979 when the widespread monitoring of the atmosphere from satellites was introduced. A comparison with independent mean sea-level pressure data from ice drifting buoys shows that {\{}ERA-Interim{\}} is clearly the most accurate at capturing the details of individual weather systems over the neighbouring Bellingshausen Sea, implying that it is also accurate over the Amundsen Sea. In terms of climatological means, the five recently-produced (after approximate to 2000) reanalysis datasets show only small differences. Decadal variations of westerly winds congruent with the observed increases in the southern annular mode ({\{}SAM){\}} index are a consistent feature across the reanalysis datasets. In particular, the strong seasonal dependence of observed trends in the {\{}SAM{\}} (i.e. significant positive trends in the summer and autumn in recent decades) is also seen in the strength of westerly winds over the Amundsen Sea. In terms of year-to-year variability, the annual mean westerly winds over the Amundsen Sea were found to be significantly correlated with the {\{}SAM{\}} in summer (r = 0.35; p0.05) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation in spring (September to November) (r = 0.41; p0.05).

abstract = {We sought to extend the spatial scale of soil-plant models by including, rather than ignoring, heterogeneity using the deposition of urine patches as an example. Our “pseudo-patches” approach preserves the most important biophysical effects but is computationally-tractable within a multi-paddock simulation. It explicitly preserves the soil carbon and nitrogen heterogeneity but does not require independent simulation of soil water and plant processes and is temporal in that the patches of heterogeneity can appear and disappear during the simulation. The approach was tested through comparison to simulations that more-closely represented field conditions and which contained independent urine patches. The testing was successful, reducing substantial error in the simulation of pasture grazed and leaching for modest increases in simulation execution time but we recommend additional testing under very low and very high stocking densities. The approach is applicable to any heterogeneity in soil nitrogen or carbon such as in spatially-managed fertiliser applications.},

abstract = {A handheld mobile laser scanning (HMLS) approach to forest inventory surveying allows virtual reconstructions of forest stands and extraction of key structural parameters from beneath the canopy, significantly reducing survey time when compared against static laser scan and fieldwork methods. A proof of concept test application demonstrated the ability of this technique to successfully extract diameter at breast height (DBH) and stem position compared against a concurrent terrestrial laser scan (TLS) survey. When stems with DBH {\textgreater} 10 cm are examined, an HMLS to TLS modelling success rate of 91{\%} was achieved with the root mean square error (RMSE) of the DBH and stem position being 1.5 cm and 2.1 cm respectively. The HMLS approach gave a survey coverage time per surveyor of 50 m2/min compared with 0.85 m2/min for the TLS instrument and 0.43 m2/min for the field study. This powerful tool has potential applications in forest surveying by providing much larger data sets at reduced operational costs to current survey methods. HMLS provides an efficient, cost effective, versatile forest surveying technique, which can be conducted as easily as walking through a plot, allowing much more detailed, spatially extensive survey data to be collected.},

Why do Wikipedia articles vary widely in quality? We investigate the relationship between collaboration and Wikipedia article quality.

Based on an empirical study, we classify contributors based on their roles in editing individual Wikipedia articles. We identify various patterns of collaboration based on the provenance or, more specifically, who does what to Wikipedia articles.

abstract = {Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) has been demon- strated to be an efficient measurement method in plot-level forest inventories.Apermanent sample plot in national forest inventories is typically a small area of forest with a radius of approximately 10 m. In practice, whether reference data can be automatically and accurately collected for larger plot sizes is of great interest. It is expensive to collect references in large areas utilizing conventional measurement tools. The application of static TLS is a possible choice but is very challenging due to its lack of mobility. In this letter, a mobile laser scanning (MLS) system was tested and its implications for forest inventories were discussed. The system is composed of a high performance laser scanner, a navigation unit, and a six-wheeled all-terrain vehicle. In this experiment, about 0.4 ha forest area wasmapped utilizing the MLS system. The stem mapping accuracy was 87.5{\%}; the root mean square errors of the estimations of the diameter at breast height and the location were 2.36 cm and 0.28 m, respectively. These results indicate that the MLS system has the potential to accurately map large forest plots and further research on mapping accuracy and cost–benefit analyses is needed.},

abstract = {Lidar remote sensing has emerged as one of the best technologies for mapping aboveground biomass in forest systems. Recent developments in lidar instruments, computer processing power, and algorithm development have enabled the mapping of individual tree structure from lidar remote sensing, yet the utility of individual tree metrics has not been fully explored for aboveground biomass mapping. Conversely, scaling-based approaches using minimal data inputs have recently been presented as an alternative method for mapping regional biomass. We compare these two emerging avenues of lidar-based biomass mapping to plot-aggregated biomass modeling techniques. We assess three forested ecosystems: a mature, closed-canopy deciduous broadleaf forest; a mature evergreen needleleaf forest; and a Loblolly pine plantation with a range of even-aged stands. For individual tree based approaches, individual tree metrics improve explanatory power from R2=0.57 to R2=0.85 in the mature conifer site, but do not show statistically significant improvements in the other two sites. We suggest that with large field sample plots in areas of open canopy cover, individual tree metrics can significantly improve aboveground biomass (AGBM) estimation as they directly take into account stand density. Regarding scaling-based approaches, we demonstrate that the proposed methods are currently unsuitable at local scales in forests without a tight relationship between canopy top height and basal area, as seen in two of our study areas. Individual tree information shows promise for improving AGBM modeling capabilities, and may also facilitate scaling-based approaches, but further research regarding the application of allometric equations and the spatial scale of models is necessary to continue advancing the field of high-resolution forest biomass accounting.},

abstract = {In many application areas like e-science and data-warehousing detailed information about the origin of data is required. This kind of information is often re- ferred to as data provenance or data lineage. The provenance of a data item includes information about the processes and source data items that lead to its creation and current representation. The diversity of data representation models and application domains has lead to a number of more or less formal definitions of provenance. Most of them are limited to a special application domain, data representation model or data processing facility. Not surprisingly, the associated implementations are also restricted to some application domain and depend on a special data model. In this paper we give a survey of data provenance models and prototypes, present a general categorization scheme for provenance models and use this categorization scheme to study the proper- ties of the existing approaches. This categorization enables us to distinguish between different kinds of provenance information and could lead to a better understanding of provenance in general. Besides the categorization of provenance types, it is important to include the storage, transformation and query requirements for the different kinds of provenance information and application domains in our considerations. The analysis of existing approaches will assist us in revealing open research problems in the area of data provenance.},

abstract = {Accurate measures of forest structural parameters are essential to forest inventory and growth models, managing wildfires, and modeling of carbon cycle. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) fills the gap between tree scale manual measurements and large scale airborne LiDAR measurements by providing accurate below crown information through non-destructive methods. This study developed innovative methods to extract individual tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and crown width of trees in East Texas. Further, the influence of scan settings, such as leaf-on/leaf-off seasons, tree distance from the scanner, and processing choices, on the accuracy of deriving tree measurements were also investigated. DBH was retrieved by cylinder fitting at different height bins. Individual trees were extracted from the TLS point cloud to determine tree heights and crown widths. The R-squared value ranged from 0.91 to 0.97 when field measured DBH was validated against TLS derived DBH using different methods. An accuracy of 92{\%} (RMSE = 1.51 m) was obtained for predicting tree heights. The R-squared value was 0.84 and RMSE was 1.08 m when TLS derived crown widths were validated using field measured crown widths. Examples of underestimations of field measured forest structural parameters due to tree shadowing have also been discussed in this study. The results from this study will benefit foresters and remote sensing studies from airborne and spaceborne platforms, for map upscaling or calibration purposes, for aboveground biomass estimation, and prudent decision making by the forest management.},

Livestock deposition events contributes to high spatial variability within the field and generate uncertainties when assessing the contribution that animal waste has on nitrogen pollution pathways. This study investigated an innovative technique for identifying the spatial coverage of urine deposition in grasslands without the need for manual soil measurements. A Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) using a twin camera system was used to identify urine patches in a 5 ha field, which had been grazed by sheep 3 weeks previous to measurements. The imagery was processed using Agisoft Photoscan (Agisoft LLC) to produce true and false color orthomosaic imagery of the entire field. Imagery of five areas (225 m 2) within the field were analyzed using a custom R script. For a total of 1,125 m 2 of grassland, 12.2{\%} of the area consisted of what was classified as urine patch. A simple up-scaling method was applied to these data to calculate N 2 O emissions for the entire field providing an estimate of 1.3–2.0 kg N 2 O-N ha −1 emissions from urine and fertilizer inputs.},

abstract = {We developed a method to produce a 3-D voxel-based solid model of a tree based on portable scanning lidar data for accurate estimation of the volume of the woody material. First, we obtained lidar measurements with a high laser pulse density from several measurement positions around the target, a Japanese zelkova tree. Next, we converted lidar-derived point-cloud data for the target into voxels. The voxel size was 0.5cm??0.5cm??0.5cm. Then, we used differences in the spatial distribution of voxels to separate the stem and large branches (diameter{\textgreater}1cm) from small branches (diameter???1cm). We classified the voxels into sets corresponding to the stem and to each large branch and then interpolated voxels to fill out their surfaces and their interiors. We then merged the stem and large branches with the small branches. The resultant solid model of the entire tree was composed of consecutive voxels that filled the outer surface and the interior of the stem and large branches, and a cloud of voxels equivalent to small branches that were discretely scattered in mainly the upper part of the target. Using this model, we estimated the woody material volume by counting the number of voxels in each part and multiplying the number of voxels by the unit voxel volume (0.13cm3). The percentage error of the volume of the stem and part of a large branch was 0.5{\%}. The estimation error of a certain part of the small branches was 34.0{\%}. ?? 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).},

abstract = {Individual tree growth is controlled by numerous factors, but intertree competition is of special importance as it is the only parameter that can be managed by silvicultural measures. Many indices dealing with aboveground interference use geometric standard crown shapes to quantify the competitive strength of neighbors on the target tree. As such crowns do not realistically represent the spatial heterogeneity in the canopy, a terrestrial laser scanner was used to gain detailed information on crown characteristics which may be used for a more precise modeling of the relationship between competition and growth. We examined groups of 5 trees growing in three major geographic regions of Germany to investigate the effect of intra- and interspecific competition for light on basal area growth of target beech trees (Fagus sylvatica). A competition index based on individual crown shapes derived from TLS-data correlated better with target tree growth than an index using conventional geometric crown shape models. Both measures ascribed the highest competitive strength to intraspecific competition. In contrast to the valuable hardwoods for which a slightly lower crown competition was calculated, the conifer species Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) had considerably weaker competitive effects on beech. The growth response of the investigated target trees reflected the strength in competition (highest relative basal area growth of beech if mixed with Scots pine. Norway spruce. valuable hardwoods. intraspecific competition) even though the increment measurements with self-acting dendrometers covered only one vegetation period. Neighborhood diversity and target tree growth were correlated, indicating stronger effects of intra- compared to interspecific interference. The utilization of a terrestrial laser scanner provided insights into canopy structure of the competitive neighborhood that may enhance our understanding of competitive interactions. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Rodent outbreaks in New Zealand are strongly driven by resource (food) avail- ability irrespective of the ecosystem. The irregular masting by native southern beech (Nothofagus spp.) and rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) trees causes interannual fluctuations in invasive rodents, primarily house mice (Mus muscu- lus) and kiore (Rattus exulans) in the rare places they occur. Nonsynchronous masting of forest trees precedes increases in ship rat (R. rattus) populations in mixed forests, although these increases are more regular and less intense. In this chapter, we describe the resource drivers of these population irruptions and summarize the conservation impacts caused by the periodic irruptions of rodents in native forests.},

abstract = {Evaluation of corn (Zea mays L.) N management and soil residual NO 3-N late in the growing season could provide important management information for subsequent small grain crops and about potential NO 3-Nloss. Our objective was to evaluate the ability of several late-season corn measurements, which have been advocated to assess N management, to identify sites with levated soil residual NO 3-N. These crop-based measurements were collected at three reproductive phases and included normalized diference vegetative index (NDVI) at 10 site-years and green-leaf number and chlorophyll (SPAD) meter readings at six of these sites. The corn stalk nitrate test (CSNT) and postharvest soil residual NO 3-N were measured at all sites. Four levels of N were applied, ranging from N deficient (0 or 67 kg N ha -1) to excessive (269 kg N ha -1). The CSNT was positively (p {\textless} 0.001) correlated with residual NO3-N, although residual NO 3-N was not always low at CSNT values {\textless}2.0 g NO 3-Nkg -1, where drought reduced production. Drought stress was a major factor influencing excess N supply and residual soil NO 3-N. Canopy measurement values at growth stages R3-R4, including NDVI, which can be measured remotely, were effective indicators of drought stress. Across sites, relative canopy readings best predicted relative grain yield when collected at R3-R4, underscoring the importance of reference strips. Use of remotely measured NDVI would allow policymakers to identify drought sites in the late summer and target them for cover crop planting, thus reducing potential winter NO 3-Nlosses in humid regions. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the American Society of Agronomy.},

abstract = {We propose a novel photogrammetric method for field plot inventory, designed for simplicity and time efficiency on-site. A prototype multi-camera rig was used to acquire images from field plot centers in multiple directions. The acquisition time on-site was less than two minutes. From each view, a point cloud was generated using a novel, rig-based matching of detected SIFT keypoints. Stems were detected in the merged point cloud, and their positions and diameters were estimated. The method was evaluated on 25 hemi-boreal forest plots of a 10-m radius. Due to difficult lighting conditions and faulty hardware, imagery from only six field plots was processed. The method performed best on three plots with clearly visible stems with a 76{\%} detection rate and 0{\%} commission. Diameters could be estimated for 40{\%} of the stems with an RMSE of 2.8–9.5 cm. The results are comparable to other camera-based methods evaluated in a similar manner. The results are inferior to TLS-based methods. However, our method is easily extended to multiple station image schemas, something that could significantly improve the results while retaining low commission errors and time on-site. Furthermore, with smaller hardware, we believe this could be a useful technique for measuring stem attributes in the forest.},

abstract = {Mapping large-scale underground environments, such as mines and tunnels, is typically a time-consuming and challenging endeavor. Existing methods based on terrestrial laser scanning are inefficient, and commercial mobile mapping systems are not suitable for underground use. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) solutions have the potential to efficiently survey underground environments while continuously moving, without relying on external positioning systems. However, no three-dimensional (3D) SLAM systems have thus far been demonstrated to be capable of mapping underground mines at kilometer scales. We have developed a solution that can accurately estimate, based on laser range and inertial measurements, the six-degrees-of-freedom trajectory of a sensor platform that continuously moves through an environment, as well as a 3D point cloud map of that environment. The key software components of the solution are continuous-time non-rigid registration, scalable place recognition, and robust pose graph optimization. A system consisting of a spinning 2D laser scanner and an industrial-grade inertial measurement unit mounted on a light vehicle was deployed at Northparkes Mine in Australia and used to map over 17 km of mine tunnel in 113 min while traveling at typical mine traffic speeds. Our processing software automatically produces a trajectory and point cloud of the mine in under half of the data acquisition time. The accuracy of the solution exceeds the raw sensor characteristics and matches closely to a surveyed map of the same environment. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Urine of grazing livestock is the greatest contributor to leached nitrogen (N) in our environment. While many N cycling models have used average urine excretions as input data, concentration and volume of individual urination events can vary greatly. Stock camps receive large amounts of urine and pose a high risk of N leaching, especially when animals are set stocked over several days. A new urine sensor is described, along with the variation in urine characteristics of break-grazed cows. N leaching was modelled based on sensor data collection, and paddock-scale estimates were compared to those based on average urine data. There was a 10{\%} difference in estimated N leached by two pumice soils, but both leached 10{\%} less N when varying urine values were used compared to average urine values. The new data showed a frequency distribution pattern of urinary N concentration in urination events that differed to that estimated using earlier data. Thus, frequency distribution patterns have a large effect on modelled N leaching loss and need to be based on extensive data collection to increase the confidence in improving estimates of N leaching. Campsites, which occupy 5–15{\%} of a hill country paddock, account for about half of all excreted urine; their locations can be predicted for the targeting of N-loss mitigation strategies using a simple topographic map of the farm.},

abstract = {Foehn winds are a prominent feature of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) climate, and are responsible for periods of strong winds and warming. The foehn mechanism determined from a case study presented in earlier work is shown here to be robust for a set of the MDVs summer foehn events over the 1994–2009 period using output from the Polar Weather Research and Forecasting Model (Polar WRF). Gap flow south of the MDVs is evidenced by the positive relationship between the pressure gradient and near-surface wind speed along the gap. Subsequently, mountain waves are generated and result in adiabatic warming and the downward transport of warm air into the MDVs, and differences in mountain wave characteristics depend on the ambient wind direction and the degree of flow nonlinearity. Pressure-driven channelling then brings warm foehn air downvalley. Although a large range of synoptic-scale circulation patterns can drive foehn events, the warmest foehn events are typically associated with blocking highs over the Australian sector of the Southern Ocean, leading to warm air advection over continental Antarctica. The episodic nature of foehn events, and the tenuous connections between such events and interannual modes of climate variability, suggests that intraseasonal variability may be more important for determining their frequency and magnitude. The extraordinarily warm austral summer of 2001/2002 across Antarctica shows that advection of warm maritime air into the continental interior and strong flow aloft result in warm foehn conditions and significant melt for the MDVs. },

abstract = {We address the place recognition problem, which we define as the problem of establishing whether an observed location has been previously seen, and if so, determining the transformation aligning the current observations to an existing map. In the contexts of robot navigation and mapping, place recognition amounts to globally localizing a robot or map segment without being given any prior estimate. An efficient method of solving this problem involves first selecting a set of keypoints in the scene which store an encoding of their local region, and then utilizing a sublinear-time search into a database of keypoints previously generated from the global map to identify places with common features. We present an algorithm to embed arbitrary keypoint descriptors in a reduced-dimension metric space, in order to frame the problem as an efficient nearest neighbor search. Given that there are a multitude of possibilities for keypoint design, we propose a general methodology for comparing keypoint location selection heuristics and descriptor models that describe the region around the keypoint. With respect to selecting keypoint locations, we introduce a metric that encodes how likely it is that the keypoint will be found in the presence of noise and occlusions during mapping passes. Metrics for keypoint descriptors are used to assess the distinguishability between the distributions of matches and non-matches and the probability the correct match will be found in an approximate k-nearest neighbors search. Verification of the test outcomes is done by comparing the various keypoint designs on a kilometers-scale place recognition problem. We apply our design evaluation methodology to three keypoint selection heuristics and six keypoint descriptor models. A full place recognition system is presented, including a series of match verification algorithms which effectively filter out false positives. Results from city-scale and long-term mapping problems illustrate our approach for both offline and online SLAM, map merging, and global localization and demonstrate that our algorithm is able to produce accurate maps over trajectories of hundreds of kilometers.

Terrestrial laser scanning is one such technique which could provide this structural information. Commercial instrumentation to suit this purpose has existed for some time now, but cost can be a prohibitive barrier for some applications. As such we recently developed a unique laser scanning system from readily-available components, supporting low cost, highly portable, and rapid measurement of below-canopy 3D forest structure. Tools were developed to automatically reconstruct tree stem models as an initial step towards virtual forest scene generation. The objective of this paper is to assess the potential of this hardware/algorithm suite to reconstruct 3D stem information for a single scan of a New England hardwood forest site. Detailed tree stem structure (e.g., taper, sweep, and lean) is recovered for trees of varying diameter, species, and range from the sensor. Absolute stem diameter retrieval accuracy is 12.5{\%}, with a 4.5{\%} overestimation bias likely due to the LiDAR beam divergence.},

abstract = {Distinctive inter-annual patterns of tree seed production can include spatial synchronicity, periodicity, and high variability among individuals within a population. Synchronicity and high variability are now commonly used to define mast seeding, with 'strict' mast seeding further distinguished by annual seed production that is either often large or nil and thus bimodal. Here we test for synchronicity, periodicity, and bimodality using 43 years of annual total and viable seed counts, along four transect lines, sampling an elevation gradient (480-1340 m) in a monospecific New Zealand mountain beech Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides forest. We expect most support for periodicity and bimodality at relatively high elevation sites that are most resource limited and known to have the greatest variability in seed production. While there was weak evidence for differences in viable seed counts along the elevation gradient, this was not the case for total seed counts. A significant year-effect on seed counts provided some evidence for synchronization, but the correlations of total or viable seed counts rapidly declined (from 0.96 to 0.58) with increasing elevation difference among transect lines. Although we detected a seven-year periodicity in total and viable seed counts at each elevation, we also detected other period lengths at most elevations. We did not find evidence for our expectation of increased period length and bimodality in relatively unproductive high elevation mountain beech forests because they would take more time to recover from seeding events. As a consequence, if resource limitation is an important driver of mountain beech seed production its influence must be strongly regulated by other factors to determine the distinctive characteristics (periodicity and synchronicity but not bimodality) of inter-annual variation in seed production. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Ensuring successful forest regeneration requires an effective monitoring program to collect information regarding the status of young crop trees and nearby competing vegetation. Current field-based assessment methodology provides the needed information, but is costly, and therefore assessment frequency is low. This often allows undesirable forest structures to develop that do not coincide with management objectives. Remote sensing techniques provide a potentially low-cost alternative to field-based assessment, but require the development of methods to easily and accurately extract the required information. Automated tree detection and delineation algorithms may be an effective means to accomplish this task. In this study, a tree detection–delineation algorithm designed specifically for high-resolution digital imagery of 6-year-old trees is presented and rigorously evaluated. The algorithm is based on the analysis of local transects extending outward from a potential tree apex. The crown boundary is estimated using the point of maximum rate of change in the transect data and a rule base is applied to ensure that the point is contextually suitable. This transect approach is implemented in both the tree-detection and crown-delineation phases. The tree-detection algorithm refines the results of an initial local maximum filter by providing an outline for each detected tree and retaining only one local maximum value within this outline. The crown-delineation algorithm is similar to the detection algorithm, but applies a different rule set in creating a more detailed crown outline. Results show that the algorithm's tree-detection accuracy was better than that using commonly applied fixed-window local maximum filters; it achieved a best result of 91{\%}. For the crown-delineation algorithm, measured diameters from delineated crowns were within 17.9{\%} of field measurements of diameter at the crown base on an individual tree basis and within 3{\%} when averaged for the study. Tests of image pixel spacings from 5 to 30 cm showed that tree-detection accuracy was stable except at the lowest (30-cm) resolution where errors were unacceptable. Delineated crown-diameter accuracy was more sensitive to image resolution, decreasing consistently and nonlinearly with increasing pixel spacing. These results highlight the need for very high resolution imagery in automated object-based analysis of forest regeneration.},

abstract = {Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) provides an accurate means of analyzing individual tree attributes, and can be extended to plots using multiple TLS scans. However, multiple TLS scans may reduce the effectiveness of individual tree structure quantification, often due to understory occupation, mutual tree occlusion, and other influences. The procedure to delineate accurate tree attributes from plot scans involves onerous steps and automated integration is challenging in the literature. This study proposes a fully automatic approach composed of ground filtering, stem detection, and stem form extraction algorithms, with emphasis on accuracy and feasibility. The delineated attributes can be useful to analyze terrain, tree biomass and fiber quality. The automation was experimented on a mature pine plot in Finland with both single scan (SS) and multiple scans (MS) datasets. With mensuration as reference, digital terrain models (DTM), stem locations, diameters at breast height (DBHs), stem heights, and stem forms of the whole plot were extracted and validated. Results of this study were best using the multiple scans (MS) dataset, where 76{\%} of stems were detected (n = 49). Height extraction accuracy was 0.68 (r2) and 1.7 m (RMSE), and DBH extraction accuracy was 0.97 (r2) and 0.90 cm (RMSE). Height-wise stem diameter extraction accuracy was 0.76 (r2) and 2.4 cm (RMSE).},

abstract = {Vegetation phenology studies the timing of recurring seasonal dynamics and can be monitored through estimates of plant area index (PAI). Shifts in spring phenology are a key indicator for the effect of climate change, in particular the start of the growing season of forests. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), also referred to as terrestrial LiDAR, is an active remote sensing technique and measures the forest structure with high spatial detail and accuracy. TLS provides information about the 3D distribution of canopy constituents and vertical plant profiles can be derived from these data. Vertical plant profiles describe the plant area per unit volume as a function of height, and can be used to used to monitor seasonal dynamics through PAI. Here, we present a TLS time series based on 48 measurement days of four sampling locations in a deciduous forest in the Netherlands. Vertical plant profiles are derived for each measurement and allow us to quantify not only total canopy integrated PAI, but also monitor PAI at specific horizontal layers. Sigmoidal models show a good fit to the derived total canopy integrated PAI time series (CV(RMSE) {\textless}2.4{\%} and CCC {\textgreater}0.99). The start of season (SOS) based on these models occurs between March 29 and April 3, 2014, depending on the species composition. The SOS derived from the TLS data corresponds well with field observations and occurs 7-12 days earlier compared to the SOS estimate from the MODIS NDVI time series. This is mainly caused by the lower relative standard deviation for TLS measurements in leaf-off conditions (0.72{\%} compared to 2.87{\%} for the MODIS NDVI data), which allows us to significantly detect small changes in phenology earlier. TLS allows us to monitor PAI at specific horizontal layers and we defined an understorey, intermediate and upper canopy layer. Even though our study area had only a sparse understorey, small differences are observed in the SOS between the different layers. We expect that these phenological differences will be more pronounced in multi-layered forests and TLS shows the potential to study seasonal dynamics not only as a function of time, but also as a function of canopy height.},

abstract = {In the study of habitat use by animals, it is important to sample vegetation structure or thedegree of cover at different heights or in vegetation strata. Commonly-used techniques toestimate vegetation cover (e.g. point height intercept) are time-consuming and can be especially subjective in tall forest environments. We investigated the application of aTerrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) to quantify forest structure, in terms of evenness andfunctional diversity. We also explored the suitability of the developed lasergrammetric technique (LGT) in the monitoring of nest site preferences of translocated populations ofNew Zealand endemic birds, the South Island saddleback (Philesturnus carunculatus) and theNew Zealand robin (Petroica australis). At an acquisition rate of up to 6000 points per secondand with an estimated error of less than 2 cm, the LGT technique utilises terrestrial scannersthat allow collection and processing of field data rapidly and precisely. Further, LGT is ableto account for small structural elements such as minor branches, leaves and vine stems. Thederived measures (mean height of canopy (MCH), indices of structural evenness (Evar) andfunctional diversity (FDvar)) can quantified vertical variations in vegetation density butappeared highly dependent on the vertical scale of measurement. When applied to anecological case study, results suggested that the LGT method provides complementaryquantitative estimates to summary methods when assessing vegetation structure formicro-scale studies. However, further validations of the LGT accuracy are needed morespecifically in relation to density of obstructing vegetation and when used in the measuringof small vegetative objects and total biomass estimates. The development of new softwarepackages that easily convert large amounts of three-dimensional data collected using laserscanners, into a form ready for biostatistical analysis, also is strongly encouraged.},

abstract = {Temperature is a main driver for most ecological processes, and temperature time series provide key environmental indicators for various applications and research fields. High spatial and temporal resolutions are crucial for detailed analyses in various fields of research. A disadvantage of temperature data obtained by satellites is the occurrence of gaps that must be reconstructed. Here, we present a new method to reconstruct high-resolution land surface temperature (LST) time series at the continental scale gaining 250-m spatial resolution and four daily values per pixel. Our method constitutes a unique new combination of weighted temporal averaging with statistical modeling and spatial interpolation. This newly developed reconstruction method has been applied to greater Europe, resulting in complete daily coverage for eleven years. To our knowledge, this new reconstructed LST time series exceeds the level of detail of comparable reconstructed LST datasets by several orders of magnitude. Studies on emerging diseases, parasite risk assessment and temperature anomalies can now be performed on the continental scale, maintaining high spatial and temporal detail. We illustrate a series of applications in this paper. Our dataset is available online for download as time aggregated derivatives for direct usage in GIS-based applications.},

abstract = {Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) can generate three-dimensional (3D) point cloud which can be used to characterize horizontal and vertical forest structure, so it has become a popular tool for forest research. Recently, various methods based on top-down scheme have been developed to segment individual tree from lidar data. Some of these methods, such as the one developed by Li et al. (2012), can obtain the accuracy up to 90{\%} when applied in coniferous forests. However, the accuracy will decrease when they are applied in deciduous forest because the interlacing tree branches can increase the difficulty to determine the tree top. In order to solve challenges of the tree segmentation in deciduous forests, we develop a new bottom-up method based on the intensity and 3D structure of leaf-off lidar point cloud data in this study. We applied our algorithm to segment trees in a forest at the Shavers Creek Watershed in Pennsylvania. Three indices were used to assess the accuracy of our method: recall, precision and F-score. The results show that the algorithm can detect 84{\%} of the tree (recall), 97{\%} of the segmented trees are correct (precision) and the overall F-score is 90{\%}. The result implies that our method has good potential for segmenting individual trees in deciduous broadleaf forest. ?? 2014 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {Provenance, a metadata component referring to the origin and the processes undertaken to obtain a specific geographic digital feature or product, is crucial to evaluate the quality of spatial information and help in reproducing and replicating geospatial processes. However, the heterogeneity and complexity of the geospatial processes, which can potentially modify part or the complete content of datasets, make evident the necessity for describing geospatial provenance at dataset, feature and attribute levels. This paper presents the application of W3C PROV, which is a generic specification to express provenance records, for representing geospatial data provenance at these different levels. In particular, W3C PROV is applied to feature models, where geospatial phenomena are represented as individual features described with spatial (point, lines, polygons, etc.) and non-spatial (names, measures, etc.) attributes. This paper first analyses the potential for representing geospatial provenance in a distributed environment at the three levels of granularity using ISO 19115 and W3C PROV models. Next, an approach for applying the generic W3C PROV provenance model to the geospatial environment is presented. As a proof of concept, we provide an application of W3C PROV to describe geospatial provenance at the feature and attribute levels. The use case presented consists of a conflation of the U.S. Geological Survey dataset with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency dataset. Finally, an example of how to capture the provenance resulting from workflows and chain executions with PROV is also presented. The application uses a web processing service, which enables geospatial processing in a distributed system and allows to capture the provenance information based on the W3C PROV ontology at the feature and attribute levels.},

Recently a new program (named Fmask) designed to accomplish these tasks was introduced for use with images from Landsats 4-7 (Zhu {\&} Woodcock, 2012). In this paper, there are the following: (1) improvements in the Fmask algorithm for Landsats 4-7; (2) a new version for use with Landsat 8 that takes advantage of the new cirrus band; and (3) a prototype algorithm for Sentinel 2 images. Though Sentinel 2 images do not have a thermal band to help with cloud detection, the new cirrus band is found to be useful for detecting clouds, especially for thin cirrus clouds. By adding a new cirrus cloud probability and removing the steps that use the thermal band, the Sentinel 2 scenario achieves significantly better results than the Landsats 4-7 scenario for all 7 images tested. For Landsat 8, almost all the Fmask algorithm components are the same as for Landsats 4-7, except a new cirrus cloud probability is calculated using the new cirrus band, which improves detection of thin cirrus clouds. Landsat 8 results are better than the Sentinel 2 scenario, with 6 out of 7 test images showing higher accuracies.},

Yet applications of this technology have out-paced understanding of the relationship between collection method and data quality. Here, UAV-SFM remote sensing was used to produce 3D multispectral point clouds of Temperate Deciduous forests at different levels of UAV altitude, image overlap, weather, and image processing. Error in canopy height estimates was explained by the alignment of the canopy height model to the digital terrain model (R2 = 0.81) due to differences in lighting and image overlap. Accounting for this, no significant differences were observed in height error at different levels of lighting, altitude, and side overlap. Overall, accurate estimates of canopy height compared to field measurements (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 3.6 m) and LIDAR (R2 = 0.99, RMSE = 3.0 m) were obtained under optimal conditions of clear lighting and high image overlap ({\textgreater}80{\%}). Variation in point cloud quality appeared related to the behavior of SFM ‘image features'. Future research should consider the role of image features as the fundamental unit of SFM remote sensing, akin to the pixel of optical imaging and the laser pulse of LIDAR.},

abstract = {Urine patches deposited by grazing cattle represent 'hot-spots' of very high nitrogen (N) loading from which environmentally important losses of N may occur (ammonia and nitrous oxide emissions, nitrate leaching). Information on the quantities of N deposited to grazed pastures as urine, the spatial and temporal distribution of urine patches and how these may be influenced by pasture management practices is limited. The objectives of this study were to assess the potential of recently developed urine sensors for providing data on urination behaviour by grazing cattle and relate this to measurements of ammonia emissions from the grazed paddocks. A total of six trials were conducted across two sites; two on a 1 ha paddock at Easter Bush near Edinburgh using beef cattle (c. 630 kg live weight) and four on a 0.5 ha paddock at North Wyke in Devon using in-calf dairy heifers (c. 450 kg live weight). Laboratory calibrations were conducted to provide sensor-specific functions for urine volume and N concentration. The quantity and quality of data from the urine sensors improved with successive trials through modifications to the method of attachment to the cow. The number of urination events per animal per day was greater for the dairy heifers, with a mean value of 11.6 (se 0.70) compared with 7.6 (se 0.76) for the beef cattle. Volume per urination event (mean 1.8, range 0.4-6.4 L) and urine N concentration (range 0.6-31.5 g L-1, excluding outliers) were similar for the two groups of cattle. Ammonia emission measurements were unsuccessful in most of the trials. The urine sensors have potential to provide useful information on urine N deposition by grazing cattle but suggested improvements including making the sensors lighter, designing a better method of attachment to the cow and including a more reliable location sensor.},

In the final report of the project, Kaartinen and Hyypp{\"{a}} (2008) re ported a high variation in the quality of the published methods under boreal forest conditions and with varying laser point densities. This paper summarizes the findings beyond th e final report after analyz ing the results obtained in different tree height classe s. Omission/Commission statisti cs as well as neighborhood relations are taken into account. Additionally, four automatic tree detection and extraction techniques were added to the test. Several methods in this experiment were superior to manual processing in the dominant, co-dominant and suppressed tree storeys. In general, as expected, the taller the tree, the better the location accuracy. The accuracy of tree height, after removing gross errors, was better than 0.5 m in all tree height classes with the best methods investigated in this experiment. Fo r forest inventory, minimum curvature-based tree detection accompanied by point cloud-based cl uster detection for suppressed trees is a solution that deserves attention in the future.},

abstract = {Masting, the intermittent production of large flower or seed crops by a population of perennial plants, can enhance the reproductive success of participating plants and drive fluctuations in seed-consumer populations and other ecosystem components over large geographic areas. The spatial and taxonomic extent over which masting is synchronized can determine its success in enhancing individual plant fitness as well as its ecosystemlevel effects, and it can indicate the types of proximal cues that enable reproductive synchrony. Here, we demonstrate high intra- and intergeneric synchrony in mast seeding by 17 species of New Zealand plants from four families across {\textgreater} 150 000 km2. The synchronous species vary ecologically (pollination and dispersal modes) and are geographically widely separated, so intergeneric synchrony seems unlikely to be adaptive per se. Synchronous fruiting by these species was associated with anomalously high temperatures the summer before seedfall, a cue linked with the La Ni{\~{n}}a phase of El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation. The lone asynchronous species appears to respond to summer temperatures, but with a 2-yr rather than 1-yr time lag. The importance of temperature anomalies as cues for synchronized masting suggests that the timing and intensity of masting may be sensitive to global climate change, with widespread effects on taxonomically disparate plant and animal communities.},

Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) can be used to derive unbiased and non-destructive estimates of tree structure and volume and can, therefore, be used to address key uncertainties in forest AGB estimates. Here we review our experience of TLS sampling strategies from 27 campaigns conducted over the past 5 years, across tropical and temperate forest plots, where data was captured with a RIEGL VZ-400 laser scanner. The focus is on strategies to derive Geometrical Modelling metrics (e.g. tree volume) over forest plots (≥1 ha) which require the accurate co-registration of 10s to 100s of individual point clouds. We recommend a 10 m  × 10 m sampling grid as an approach to produce a point cloud with a uniform point distribution, that can resolve higher order branches (down to a few cm in diameter) towards the top of 30+ m canopies and can be captured in a timely fashion i.e.∼3–6 days per ha. A data acquisition protocol, such as presented here, would facilitate data interoperability and inter-comparison of metrics between instruments/groups, from plot to plot and over time.},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) leaching losses from grazing systems originate primarily from animal urine patches. The N load in urine patches has strong effects on N leaching and varies largely with variations in volume and N concentration of urination events. The effects of these variations in volume and N concentration of urination events on N leaching have not yet been explored. We present a framework for assessing N leaching losses from grazed pastures that incorporates variations of urination events. We found that, for the same amount of urinary N deposition, annual N leaching losses at paddock level increased logarithmically with increased mean urine volume or N concentration, though N leaching at urine patch level increased exponentially with N deposition rate. The estimates of N leaching losses using mean urine patches, derived from mean urine volume and N concentration, would be less than that estimated using variable urine patches as deposited by animals. Results for a case-study pasture on free-draining pumice soils indicate that, for the same number of urination events, depositing the same amount of urinary N within a year, N leaching would be underestimated by 5-8{\%}, when using average urine patches as opposed to varying both volume and N concentration; and the underestimation would be bigger for pastures on soils of greater water holding capacity. Our results indicate the necessity of more accurate estimation of mean and variation patterns of urine volume and N concentration of urination events for improving estimates of N leaching risks. The results support the development of N leaching mitigation strategies by feeding animal diuretics, and are useful to recommend animal species and age class for areas of high N leaching risks. ? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A new method called Fmask (Function of mask) for cloud and cloud shadow detection in Landsat imagery is provided. Landsat Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and Brightness Temperature (BT) are used as inputs. Fmask first uses rules based on cloud physical properties to separate Potential Cloud Pixels (PCPs) and clear-sky pixels. Next, a normalized temperature probability, spectral variability probability, and brightness probability are combined to produce a probability mask for clouds over land and water separately. Then, the PCPs and the cloud probability mask are used together to derive the potential cloud layer. The darkening effect of the cloud shadows in the Near Infrared (NIR) Band is used to generate a potential shadow layer by applying the flood-fill transformation. Subsequently, 3D cloud objects are determined via segmentation of the potential cloud layer and assumption of a constant temperature lapse rate within each cloud object. The view angle of the satellite sensor and the illuminating angle are used to predict possible cloud shadow locations and select the one that has the maximum similarity with the potential cloud shadow mask. If the scene has snow, a snow mask is also produced. For a globally distributed set of reference data, the average Fmask overall cloud accuracy is as high as 96.4{\%}. The goal is development of a cloud and cloud shadow detection algorithm suitable for routine usage with Landsat images. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Plot-based TLS foliage profiles are used as training datasets for the derivation of a scaling function applied to calibrate effective leaf area index (LAIe) from a coincident ALS point cloud. The results of this study show that: a) the mean proportion of the total number of returns within 11.3m radius of the TLS scan station was 64{\%}. Increasing the radius decreased the level of detail due to occlusion; b) the relationship between TLS LAIe profile and ALS foliage percentile distribution (PD) using all, primary and secondary returns are not linearly related; and c) regressions between TLS LAIe profile and ALS PD, demonstrate better correspondence using a 5th order polynomial applied to all returns (r2=0.95; SE=0.09m2m-2) than aquasi-physically-based Weibull scaling function. The calibration routine was applied to ALS data within a GIS environment to create a 500m radius 3D map of LAIe. This localised 3D calibration of LAIe was then used as the basis to calculate the overhead canopy extinction coefficient parameter (k), and thereby facilitate upscaling of spatial LAIe estimates to larger domains using a Beer Lambert Law assumption. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Nitrate leaching from urine deposited by grazing animals is a critical constraint for sustainable dairy farming in New Zealand. While considerable progress has been made to understand the fate of nitrogen (N) under urine patches, little consideration has been given to the spread of urinary N beyond the wetted area. In this study, we modelled the lateral spread of nitrogen from the wetted area of a urine patch to the soil outside the patch using a combination of two process-based models (HYDRUS and APSIM). The simulations provided insights on the extent and temporal pattern for the redistribution of N in the soil following a urine deposition and enabled investigating the effect of lateral spread of urinary N on plant growth and N leaching. The APSIM simulation, using an implementation of a dispersion-diffusion function, was tested against experimental data from a field experiment conducted in spring on a well-drained soil. Depending on the geometry considered for the dispersion-diffusion function (plate or cylindrical) the area-averaged N leaching decreased by 8 and 37{\%} compared with simulations without lateral N spread; this was due to additional N uptake from pasture on the edge area. A sensitivity analysis showed that area-averaged pasture growth was not greatly affected by the value of the dispersion factor used in the model, whereas N leaching was very sensitive. Thus, the need to account for the edge effect may depend on the objective of the simulations. The modelling results also showed that considering lateral spread of urinary N was sufficient to describe the experimental data, but plant root uptake across urine patch zones may still be relevant in other conditions. Although further work is needed for improving accuracy, the simulated and experimental results demonstrate that accounting for the edge effect is important for determining N leaching from urine-affected areas.},

abstract = {Automated feature extraction based on prototypes is only partially successful when applied to remotely sensed imagery of natural scenes due to the complexity and unpredictability of the shape and geometry of natural features. Here, a new method is developed for extracting the locations of treetops by applying GIS (Geographical Information System) overlay techniques and morphological functions to high spatial resolution airborne imagery. This method is based on the geometrical and spatial properties of tree crowns. Airborne data of the study site in the New Forest, UK included colour aerial photographs, LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) and ATM (Airborne Thematic Mapper) imagery. A DEM (Digital Elevation Model) was generated from LIDAR data and then subtracted from the original LIDAR image to create a Canopy Height Model (CHM). A set of procedures using image contouring and the manipulation of the resulting polygons was implemented to extract treetops from the aerial photographs and the CHM. Criteria were developed and threshold values were set using a supervised approach for the acceptance or rejection of features based on field knowledge. Tree species were mapped by classifying the ATM data and these data were co-registered with the treetop layer. For broadleaved deciduous plantations the success of treetop extraction using aerial photographs was 91{\%}, but was much lower using LIDAR data. For semi-natural forests, the LIDAR produced better results than the aerial photographs with a success of 80{\%}, which was considered high, given the complexity of these uneven aged stands. The methodology presented here is easy to apply as it is implemented within a GIS and the final product is an accurate map with information about the location, height and species of each tree.},

abstract = {We propose a real-time method for odometry and mapping using range measurements from a 2-axis lidar moving in 6-DOF. The problem is hard because the range measurements are received at different times, and errors in motion estimation can cause mis-registration of the resulting point cloud. To date, coherent 3D maps can be built by off-line batch methods, often using loop closure to correct for drift over time. Our method achieves both low-drift and low-computational complexity without the need for high accuracy ranging or inertial measurements. The key idea in obtaining this level of performance is the division of the complex problem of simultaneous localization and mapping, which seeks to optimize a large number of variables simultaneously, by two algorithms. One algorithm performs odometry at a high frequency but low fidelity to estimate velocity of the lidar. Another algorithm runs at a frequency of an order of magnitude lower for fine matching and registration of the point cloud. Combination of the two algorithms allows the method to map in real-time. The method has been evaluated by a large set of experiments as well as on the KITTI odometry benchmark. The results indicate that the method can achieve accuracy at the level of state of the art offline batch methods},

abstract = {Tree detection is a major focus in the field of (semi-) automatic extraction of forest information from very high resolution remote sensing data. Many existing tree crown delineation algorithms require a set of seed pixels to start the process of image segmentation. In this study, different methods of obtaining seed pixels (semi-) automatically from orthophotos and digital surface models derived from stereo digital camera imagery are tested and compared. The UltracamD digital camera provides images with a stereo overlap of about 90{\%} and this paper presents a new method of DSM generation based on multiple stereo pairs. The evaluation of the DSMs shows that by using a multiple image approach, also referred to as block-based approach, the quality is significantly increased: the mean difference between the estimated values and 356 measured upper layer tree heights is only 0.77 m with a standard deviation of 2.39 m. In terms of seed generation, the morph algorithm (2d) used in this paper detected 64{\%} of the trees visible in the aerial photos with an error margin of around 25{\%} both for commission and omission in a dense natural forest. The orthophoto-based local maximum approach generally yielded lower accuracies and more multiple hits than the morph algorithm. 3d seed generation from the block based model returned about 70{\%} correct hits for the upper tree canopy layer. All evaluations are performed based on field measurements and visual aerial photo interpretation. Furthermore, the dependence of successful tree detection on the dominance of a tree within the stand is analyzed. As expected, suppressed trees are more likely to be omitted. The segmentation proved to be useful, as the automatically generated segments had a similar number of correct hits as achieved by visual interpretation, with the only drawback being a higher error of commission.},

LiDAR is a revolutionary technology for measurement of forest structural parameters, however, the accuracy of crown width extraction is not satisfactory when using a low density LiDAR, especially in high canopy cover forest. We used high resolution aerial imagery with a low density LiDAR system to overcome this shortcoming. A morphological filtering was used to generate a DEM (Digital Elevation Model) and a CHM (Canopy Height Model) from LiDAR data. The LiDAR camera image is matched to the aerial image with an automated keypoints search algorithm. As a result, a high registration accuracy of 0.5 pixels was obtained. A local maximum filter, watershed segmentation, and object-oriented image segmentation are used to obtain tree height and crown width. Results indicate that the camera data collected by the integrated LiDAR system plays an important role in registration with aerial imagery. The synthesis with aerial imagery increases the accuracy of forest structural parameter extraction when compared to only using the low density LiDAR data.},

abstract = {The reconstruction of trees from point clouds that were acquired with terrestrial LiDAR scanning (TLS) may become a significant breakthrough in the study and modelling of tree development. Here, we develop an efficient method and a tool based on extensive modifications to the skeletal extraction method that was first introduced by Verroust and Lazarus in 2000. PypeTree, a user-friendly and open-source visual modelling environment, incorporates a number of improvements into the original skeletal extraction technique, making it better adapted to tackle the challenge of tree perennial tissue reconstruction. Within PypeTree, we also introduce the idea of using semi-supervised adjustment tools to address methodological challenges that are associated with imperfect point cloud datasets and which further improve reconstruction accuracy. The performance of these automatic and semi-supervised approaches was tested with the help of synthetic models and subsequently validated on real trees. Accuracy of automatic reconstruction greatly varied in terms of axis detection because small (length {\textless} 3.5 cm) branches were difficult to detect. However, as small branches account for little in terms of total skeleton length, mean reconstruction error for cumulated skeleton length only reached 5.1{\%} and 1.8{\%} with automatic or semi-supervised reconstruction, respectively. In some cases, using the supervised tools, a perfect reconstruction of the perennial tissue could be achieved.},

abstract = {Climate observations from the McMurdo dry valleys, East Antarctica are presented from a network of seven valley floor automatic meteorological stations during the period 1986 to 2000. Mean annual temperatures ranged from {\&}{\#}8722;14.8°C to {\&}{\#}8722;30.0°C, depending on the site and period of measurement. Mean annual relative humidity is generally highest near the coast. Mean annual wind speed increases with proximity to the polar plateau. Site-to-site variation in mean annual solar flux and PAR is due to exposure of each station and changes over time are likely related to changes in cloudiness. During the nonsummer months, strong katabatic winds are frequent at some sites and infrequent at others, creating large variation in mean annual temperature owing to the warming effect of the winds. Katabatic wind exposure appears to be controlled to a large degree by the presence of colder air in the region that collects at low points and keeps the warm less dense katabatic flow from the ground. The strong influence of katabatic winds makes prediction of relative mean annual temperature based on geographical position (elevation and distance from the coast) alone, not possible. During the summer months, onshore winds dominate and warm as they progress through the valleys creating a strong linear relationship (r2 = 0.992) of increasing potential temperature with distance from the coast (0.09°C km{\&}{\#}8722;1). In contrast to mean annual temperature, summer temperature lends itself quite well to model predictions, and is used to construct a statistical model for predicting summer dry valley temperatures at unmonitored sites.},

abstract = {? 2016 American Meteorological Society.This study compares high-resolution output (1.1-km horizontal grid length) from twice-daily forecasts produced by the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) with a dense observational network east of Ross Island. Covering 10 000 km2, 15 SNOWWEB stations significantly increased the number of observation stations in the area to 19 during the 2014-15 austral summer. Collocated "virtual stations" created from AMPS output are combined with observations, producing a single dataset of zonal and meridional wind components used to train a self-organizing map (SOM). The resulting SOM is used to individually classify the observational and AMPS datasets, producing a time series of classifications for each dataset directly comparable to the other. Analysis of class composites shows two dominant weather patterns: low but directionally variable winds and high but directionally constant winds linked to the Ross Ice Shelf airstream (RAS). During RAS events the AMPS and SNOWWEB data displayed good temporal class alignment with good surface wind correlation. SOM analysis shows that AMPS did not accurately forecast surface-level wind speed or direction during light wind conditions where synoptic forcing was weak; however, it was able to forecast the low wind period occurrence accurately. Coggins's regimes provide synoptic-scale context and show a reduced synoptic pressure gradient during these classes, increasing reliance on the ability of Polar WRF to resolve mesoscale dynamics. Available initialization data have insufficient resolution for the region's complex topography, which likely impacts performance. The SOM analysis methods used are shown to be effective for model validation and are widely applicable.},

abstract = {Ammonia (NH 3) emissions were measured during summer from a circular area of short pasture on a slightly acid stony sandy loam soil, treated with 156 cattle urine patches of realistic size and a nitrogen (N) content of 15gN each. Horizontal fluxes of NH 3 were sampled at five heights in the centre of the treated circle. Three micrometeorological methods were used to derive the NH 3 emission rate from these horizontal fluxes: the mass-budget (MB) method, the backward-Lagrangian stochastic (BLS) method, and the ZINST (height, z, independent of stability) method. Soil temperature was measured and soil samples were taken from within selected urine patches to provide pH, ammoniacal-N (NH x-N) and moisture contents as input parameters for a volatilisation model. The model describes a chain of three processes: the phase equilibrium between aqueous NH x in the soil solution and gaseous NH 3 at the liquid-air interface (within the soil pores), the diffusion of gaseous NH 3 in the soil layer, and the diffusion of gaseous NH 3 in the atmospheric surface layer between ground and sampling height. The two diffusion processes are parameterised by resistances as functions of soil and wind flow parameters, respectively.With the MB method, 25.7 (±0.5) {\%} of the applied urine-N was found to have volatilised as NH 3 over the first 6 d. After that, the pH had dropped below 7, implying that NH 3 emissions were probably insignificant. The ZINST method provided emission rate estimates that did not differ systematically from the MB method, with 50{\%} larger random error. The BLS method underestimated the emission rate by 10 to 24{\%} (dependent on measurement height), because of the requirement to specify mean wind speed and mean concentration as input parameters, instead of the measured mean horizontal flux.The volatilisation model was not tested in predictive mode because urine penetration depth could not be determined accurately enough. Instead, from the measured NH 3 emissions and the model input parameters, the temporal evolution of the soil resistance was computed as well as an " effective source depth" associated with that. The median value of this depth was 2mm, with a typical error of a factor 2. It is concluded that the soil resistance model is physically realistic, but for accurate prediction of NH 3 emission rates, the vertical distribution of NH x-N within the urine patches must be well-characterised. If this is provided, then soil sampling together with wind speed measurements will suffice to estimate NH 3 emissions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) requires reporting net carbon stock changes and anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, including those related to forests. This paper describes the design and implementation of a nation-wide forest inventory of New Zealand's planted post-1989 forests that arose from Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry activities (LULUCF) under Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol. The majority of these forests are planted with Pinus radiata, with the remainder made up of other species exotic to New Zealand. At the start of the project there was no on-going national forest inventory that could be used as a basis for calculating carbon stocks and meet Good Practice Guidelines.A network of ground-based permanent sample plots was installed with airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) for double sampling using regression estimators to predict carbon in each of the four carbon pools of above- and below-ground live biomass, dead wood and litter. Measurement, data acquisition and quality assurance/control protocols were developed specifically for the inventory, carried out in 2007 and 2008. Plots were located at the intersection of a forest with a 4. km square grid, coincident with an equivalent 8. km square grid established over the indigenous forest and " grassland with woody biomass" (Other Wooded Land). Planted tree carbon within a ground plot was calculated by an integrated system of growth, wood density and compartment allocation models utilising the data from measurements of trees and shrubs on the plots. This system, called the Forest Carbon Predictor, predicts past and future carbon in a stand and is conditioned so that the calculated basal area and mean top height equals that obtained by conventional mensuration methods at the time of the plot measurement. Mean per hectare carbon stocks were then multiplied by an estimate of the total area of post 1989 forests obtained from wall to wall mapping using a combination of satellite imagery and ortho-photography.The network of permanent samples plots and LiDAR double sampling methodology was designed to be simple and robust to change over time. In the future, using LiDAR should achieve sampling efficiencies over using ground plots alone and reduces any problems regarding restricted access on the ground. The network is to be remeasured at the end of commitment period 1, 2012, and the carbon stocks re-estimated in order to calculate change. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

This analysis is carried out employing the tools of complex networks and a measure of nonlinear correlation for point processes such as rainfall, called event synchronization. This study provides valuable insights into the spatial organization, scales, and structure of the 90th and 94th percentile rainfall events during the Indian summer monsoon (June-September). We furthermore analyse the influence of different critical synoptic atmospheric systems and the impact of the steep Himalayan topography on rainfall patterns. The presented method not only helps us in visualising the structure of the extreme-event rainfall fields, but also identifies the water vapor pathways and decadal-scale moisture sinks over the region. Furthermore a simple scheme based on complex networks is presented to decipher the spatial intricacies and temporal evolution of monsoonal rainfall patterns over the last 6 decades.

Cows were observed for 24 h five times from July 1997 to April 1998, and for 13.5 h in September 1997. During each 24-h observation period, the first grazing period (12 h) used 54{\%} of the paddock and the second grazing period (8 h) used the entire paddock. Times and locations of all defecations and urinations from a subgroup of eight cows, observed while in the pasture, feed area, milking parlor, or in transit were recorded during the observation periods listed above and another time in May 1997. On pasture, all defecations and urinations were surveyed and mapped for all 36 cows. Feces and urine from six observation periods covered an estimated 10{\%} of the paddock area in one year. Within 30 m of the water tank, concentrations of feces and urine from three warm season observations were significantly greater than concentrations during three cool-season observations. Percentages of defecations and urinations on the pasture, feeding, and milking areas were highly correlated (r {\textgreater} 0.90) with time spent in those areas. Pasture-based systems could reduce manure handling and storage requirements proportional to the time cattle are on pastures. Manure on the pasture was evenly distributed, except around the water tank during warm weather grazings. Results indicate that pasture-based dairy systems may require smaller, less-expensive manure management systems compared with confinement dairy farms.},

Carr.) in Ireland. The data acquisition for all the plots with different tree sizes and different slopes was carried out using a terrestrial laser scanner (FARO LS 800 HE80) in November 2007 and November 2009, using the same plot centres and measurement procedures. The point cloud data were processed with Autostem™ software. The results showed that TLS enables the acquisition of forest stand parameters with an acceptable accuracy. Pruning of the lower branches did not improve tree recognition and the number of (partly) occluded trees stayed the same. Over the 2-year period, the average difference between the volume increment of the trees visible to the scanner derived using the conventional method and Autostem™ was 4.77 m3 ha−1 and resulted in scanner-derived estimates that were lower than the estimates obtained by conventional method by 6.1 {\%}. Using a simple correction factor to account for occlusion in the laser scanner data, the difference between these estimates for all trees in the stand became an over-estimation by 6.96 m3 ha−1 (8.1 {\%}). At heights up along the stems {\textgreater}15 m, the errors in stem diameter estimates started to escalate.},

In many instances, the best vantage point is from above, and as a result, there is a growing demand for low-altitude mapping solutions from micro aerial vehicles such as small quadcopters. Existing lidar-based 3D airborne mapping solutions rely on GPS/INS solutions for positioning, or focus on producing relatively low-fidelity or locally focused maps for the purposes of autonomous navigation.We have developed a generalpurpose airborne 3D mapping system capable of continuously scanning the environment during flight to produce accurate and dense point clouds without the need for a separate positioning system. A key feature of the system is a novel passively driven mechanism to rotate a lightweight 2D laser scanner using the rotor downdraft from a quadcopter. The data generated from the spinning laser is input into a continuous-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) solution to produce an accurate 6 degree-of-freedom trajectory estimate and a 3D point cloud map. Extensive results are presented illustrating the versatility of the platform in a variety of environments including forests, caves, mines, heritage sites, and industrial facilities. Comparison with conventional surveying methods and equipment demonstrates the high accuracy and precision of the proposed solution.},

abstract = {Research in low biodiversity extreme environments allows separation of the climatic, soil and biological interactions that determine soil biodiversity and community structure. Studies focused on the response of low diversity communities in soils of the Antarctic Dry Valleys and the Chihuahuan Desert of the southwestern USA, to manipulations of soil resources and climate, offer the best opportunity to learn about the environmental controls on soil biodiversity and the role of biodiversity in soil functioning. We propose that insights based on research in these extreme environments should be applicable to understanding soil biodiversity in more complex, temperate and tropical ecosystems. The study of extreme soil ecosystems may also provide information on the response of soil biodiversity to increasing occurrences of environmental extremes that are predicted to occur from global change models. Studies from hot and cold deserts show that decomposition-based food webs can be very simple, that aridity produces similar mechanisms for survival and dispersal of organisms in temperate and polar systems, that suitable soil habitats are patchily distributed in arid environments, and the low biodiversity of extreme soil ecosystems creates little or no functional redundancy making these systems susceptible to disturbance. We suggest that species within the same functional group can have small differences in ecology that are sufficient to affect ecosystem processes. When this occurs, differential responses of species to disturbance within a functional group will not stabilise the soil ecosystem, but rather lead to dramatic changes in community composition and ecosystem process rates.},

abstract = {Stand delineation and species composition estimation are cornerstones of forest inventory mapping and key elements to forest management decision making. Improved mapping techniques are constantly being sought in terms of speed, consistency, accuracy, level of detail, and overall effectiveness. Semi-automated analysis of high-resolution imagery at the individual tree crown level may offer such benefits. Methods, however, need to be developed and tested under a variety of forest conditions. High-resolution (60 cm) multispectral airborne imagery was acquired over a predominantly young conifer forest and plantation test area on the west coast of Canada. Automated tree isolation algorithms were applied to the data in order to delineate tree crowns or clusters of crowns. An object-oriented single tree classification was conducted using a maximum likelihood classifier. Stands of similar species composition, closure, and stem density were defined through a sequence that first generated images of these parameters from the automated delineation and classification, used these as input to an unsupervised classification, and then filtered and smoothed the resulting classification clusters. Because of the dense nature of the stands and small crowns on the site, the isolation process often delineated clusters of several trees. Species classification accuracy was determined by comparing the average stand composition from the automated technique to that derived from ground transects or plots. Species classification was good, with average composition error (difference between field measured and automated composition) over all 16 test stands being 7.25{\%}. Most errors for individual species in stands were below 20{\%}, but a few were up to 30{\%}. The automatically generated stand boundaries mimicked well those of known plantation and interpreted inventory boundaries. The automated technique created a few larger stands and some additional small stands in areas of complex forest structure. Overall, for the young fairly uniform stands of the site, both stand delineation and species composition estimation were of a quality suitable for operational use in inventory and forest management. Further development and testing is needed to extend results to situations covering large areas, multiple flight lines, varied topography, and different forest conditions.},

abstract = {The vertical distribution of plant constituents is a key parameter to describe vegetation structure and influences several processes, such as radiation interception, growth and habitat. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), also referred to as terrestrial LiDAR, has the potential to measure the canopy structure with high spatial detail and accuracy. Vertical plant profiles, which describe the plant area per unit volume (PAVD) as a function of height, are often used to quantify the vertical structure. However, most studies do not account for topography, use registered multiple TLS scans or use a detailed airborne LiDAR digital terrain model to account for this variation in ground height. Airborne LiDAR is often not available or expensive to acquire. Here, we present an approach that facilitates rapid, robust and automated assessment of the vertical structure of vegetation. We use single scans and local plane fitting to correct for topographic effects in vertical plant profiles and test our approach in five different Australian forest types with different topography and understorey. We validate our approach with topography-corrected vertical plant profiles with digital terrain models derived from airborne LiDAR. Our results demonstrate that not correcting for topography can lead to significant errors in the vertical distribution of plant constituents (CV(RMSE) up to 66.2{\%}, typically ranging from 4.2{\%} to 13.8{\%}). This error decreases significantly when topography is accounted for with TLS plane fitting (CV(RMSE) up to 20.6{\%}, typically ranging from 1.5{\%} to 12.6{\%}). We demonstrate that height metrics from vertical plant profiles that are not corrected for topography depart significantly from those that are inferred from the reference profile. The effect is most noticeable for canopy top height and the peak PAVD height. Correcting topography with a TLS plane fitting approach reduces the error in canopy top height by at least 77{\%} and up to 100{\%}, and reduces the error in peak PAVD height by 83.3{\%} and up to 100{\%}. We also show the advantage of a multiple return over a first return TLS instrument. The definition of the ground returns with a first return instrument might be problematic in environments with dense herbaceous understorey and there is an overall trend of lower height metrics compared to multiple return instruments. We present a data-driven approach that is based on single scan TLS data. The latter is of importance for large area sampling as it allows more sites to be sampled from existing resources and facilitate consistent processing of archived TLS data, which is often single scan data with no survey control. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In developing autonomous solutions for mapping and localization, one problem that often needs to be dealt with is determining when an area is revisited despite having poor or no prior information on the relative alignment error. There are well-formulated approaches for recognizing such matches using the rich information in camera data; however, it is a much more challenging problem using lidar sensors alone. Most existing approaches employ a pairwise place comparison of place descriptors and thus finding matches requires linear time per place. We instead propose the use of a keypoint voting approach to achieve sub-linear matching times. A constant number of nearest neighbor votes per keypoint are queried from a database of local descriptors and aggregated to determine likely place matches. It becomes critical to analyze the distributions of vote scores such that a suitable threshold for matching scores can be determined a priori, so that the system is not overwhelmed by false positives nor starved for true matches. We have empirically determined that the vote scores follow a log-normal distribution, and we are able to fit a parametric model of its hyper-parameters based on the number of neighbors, the number of keypoints in a place, and the total number of keypoints in the database. We demonstrate the performance of our system in a variety of large scale 3D lidar datasets using data collected from a continually scanning handheld lidar sensor, and also on two publicly available lidar datasets. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Foehn winds resulting from topographic modification of airflow in the lee of mountain barriers are frequently experienced in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) of Antarctica. Strong foehn winds in the MDVs cause dramatic warming at onset and have significant effects on landscape forming processes; however, no detailed scientific investigation of foehn in the MDVs has been conducted. As a result, they are often misinterpreted as adiabatically warmed katabatic winds draining from the polar plateau. Herein observations from surface weather stations and numerical model output from the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) during foehn events in the MDVs are presented. Results show that foehn winds in the MDVs are caused by topographic modification of south-southwesterly airflow, which is channeled into the valleys from higher levels. Modeling of a winter foehn event identifies mountain wave activity similar to that associated with midlatitude foehn winds. These events are found to be caused by strong pressure gradients over the mountain ranges of the MDVs related to synoptic-scale cyclones positioned off the coast of Marie Byrd Land. Analysis of meteorological records for 2006 and 2007 finds an increase of 10{\%} in the frequency of foehn events in 2007 compared to 2006, which corresponds to stronger pressure grathents in the Ross Sea region. It is postulated that the intra- and interannual frequency and intensity of foehn events in the MDVs may therefore vary in response to the position and frequency of cyclones in the Ross Sea region.

abstract = {In order to investigate the fate of contaminants accidentally spilt on Antarctic soils, known amounts of lithium chloride were added to soil plots beside Lake Vanda, in the Wright Valley, and close to Scott Base, on Ross Island. The soils were sampled over a three-year period to trace the movement of lithium. On dry sites most of the added lithium remained in the soil where it had been applied, although trace amounts had moved up to 3 m laterally. On wet sites, where moisture was available from melting snow, much greater amounts of lithium had moved laterally and could be detected up to 5 m away. Thus in dry sites, typical of most of the ice-free areas of Antarctica, accidental contaminants will only move slowly over a short distance from the spill site, whereas on wet sites, the contaminants will eventually move more rapidly and be leached out to the lowest point in the drainage system.},

abstract = {The process of understanding, analyzing and communicating the large spatial datasets commonly output from LIDAR systems is difficult. Such data typically consist of several million 3D sample points distributed over several thousand hectares. Visualization techniques can help users better understand the raw data, formulate suitable analysis methods, and present results. Unfortunately, few visualization environments can represent entire LIDAR datasets in a way that promotes easy interaction and clear understanding. Even immersive techniques such as CAVE- and headset-based systems tend to overwhelm the viewer with the shear volume of data presented. This paper describes a prototype visualization framework that fuses LIDAR data, photographs, and GIS data using 2D displays and a 3D stereoscopic visualization environment. We have used the system for projects where the terrain surface is of interest and in the derivation of vegetation characteristics from LIDAR data. The primary interface consists of a 2D display of a geo-referenced orthophoto, various point, line, and polygon overlays, and contour lines derived from a digital elevation model. Users interact with the 2D display to specify a subset of LIDAR data for stereoscopic viewing. The 3D viewing tool displays the terrain represented as a shaded surface, the specified subset of the raw LIDAR data points, and a portion of the orthophoto image mapped onto a horizontal plane that can be positioned anywhere along the vertical axis of the scene. The system provides methods for organizing and indexing large datasets making it useful for a wide variety of LIDAR projects. This paper presents an overview of the data interface and visualization system along with several examples of its use.},

abstract = {Data management is growing in complexity as large-scale applications take advantage of the loosely coupled resources brought together by grid middleware and by abundant storage capacity. Metadata describing the data products used in and generated by these applications is essential to disambiguate the data and enable reuse. Data provenance, one kind of metadata, pertains to the derivation history of a data product starting from its original sources. The provenance of data products generated by complex transformations such as workflows is of considerable value to scientists. From it, one can ascertain the quality of the data based on its ancestral data and derivations, track back sources of errors, allow automated re-enactment of derivations to update a data, and provide attribution of data sources. Provenance is also essential to the business domain where it can be used to drill down to the source of data in a data warehouse, track the creation of intellectual property, and provide an audit trail for regulatory purposes. In this paper we create a taxonomy of data provenance techniques, and apply the classification to current research efforts in the field. The main aspect of our taxonomy categorizes provenance systems based on why they record provenance, what they describe, how they represent and store provenance, and ways to disseminate it. Our synthesis can help those building scientific and business metadata-management systems to understand existing provenance system designs. The survey culminates with an identification of open research problems in the field.},

abstract = {We analyzed seed production of mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) forest along an elevational gradient in New Zealand from 1020 to 1370 m (treeline) for the years 1973-2002. We used seed production data from nine elevations and a site- and species-specific net carbon (C) availability model from two elevations (1050 in and 1340 IT) to examine how three variables (temperature, soil moisture, and net C availability) during three key periods (resource priming, flowering primordia development, and flowering) influence seed production. These three strongly interrelated variables have all been considered determinants of seed production but have not previously been tested together in a single analysis. Seed production increased over the 30-year period, with the greatest increases at high elevations; this increase was driven by a greater frequency of intermediate- sized seeding years. We then determined how temperature, soil moisture, and net C availability determined seeding, and examined whether temporal trends in the seeding data could be linked to similar temporal trends in temperature, soil moisture, or net C availability. High seed production was related to cool summers with high soil moisture during resource priming, warm summers during flower primordia development, and low net C availability during flowering. Positive temporal trends in temperatures during the period of flower primordia development accounted for the increase in seed production, suggesting that increasing temperatures are promoting more frequent seed production at high elevations.},

abstract = {Urine excreted in patches by grazing livestock accounts for much of the nitrogen (N) loss to the environment in grazing systems. These losses arise mainly through N leaching to ground water and gaseous losses to the atmosphere. Models of grazing systems ideally require data on urination frequency, N load in each urination event and spatial distribution patterns of urine. To date there has been a lack of suitable equipment for obtaining information on urination characteristics of grazing animals. This paper describes a urine sensor that detects and logs each urination event of female sheep and cattle. A thermistor suspended below the vulva continuously measures ambient temperature except when urine passes over it, causing the temperature to rise to near body temperature. Field validation showed 85{\%} and 78{\%} of sensor-detected urination events by sheep and cattle sensors, respectively, were seen by the observer. Some of the urination events identified by the sensor but not seen by the observer were confirmed by video footage. For cattle, only one observed urination event was not detected by the urine sensor, giving a 4{\%} error rate of detection. Daily urination frequencies (ewes: 13-23eventsday -1; cows: 11-26eventsday -1) were similar to published data for these species. A custom-made GPS unit worn on the rump of the ewe and on the collar of the cow logged animal position continuously so that urine patch position could be determined. Examples of urine distribution patterns by ewes and beef cows in large, hilly paddocks clearly show campsite locations where a disproportionate number of urination events occurred. For sheep, the correlation between time spent in an area and the number of urination events in the same area was r=0.82, but this correlation was weaker for cattle (r=0.54). {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Abstract Background: LiDAR is an established technology that is increasingly being used to characterise spatial variation in important forest metrics such as total stem volume. The cost of forest inventory and LiDAR acquisition are strongly related to the inventory plot size and the LiDAR pulse density, respectively. It would therefore be beneficial to understand how reductions in these variables influence the strength of relationships between LiDAR and stand metrics. Although relatively high pulse densities are required for creating Digital Terrain Models (DTMs), once a DTM has been developed there is scope for reducing pulse density on subsequent flights to estimate stand metrics from LiDAR. This study used an extensive national dataset (for which the DTM had been characterised) obtained within New Zealand's planted forests. Using this dataset, the objective of this research was to investigate how variation in both pulse density and plot size influence the precision of relationships between LiDAR metrics and total stem volume. Methods: LiDAR metrics were thinned to pulse densities ranging from 0.01 to 4 pulses m-2 across plot sizes ranging from 0.01 to 0.06 ha. For each pulse density/plot size combination regressions between LiDAR mean height and total stem volume were fitted using parameters fixed at values for the unthinned dataset or separately fitted for each pulse density/plot size combination. Results: Using the unthinned dataset (plot size = 0.06 ha; pulse density = 4 pulses m-2) the relationship between the mean LiDAR height and total stem volume had a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.77. Thinning of the data had little effect on R2 above plot sizes of 0.03 ha and pulse densities of 0.1 pulses m-2. As pulse densities decreased below 0.1 pulses m-2 within plots of less than 0.025 ha, there was a sharp decline in R2 reaching values as low as 0.48 in plots of 0.01 ha with pulse densities of 0.01 pulses m-2. Simulations where parameters were fixed yielded almost identical R2 values to those where they were refitted for each plot size/pulse density combination. The number of pulses per plot integrates the effect of these two factors, with little change in the precision of the volume function until a threshold of 100 pulses per plot was reached. Conclusions: This study showed that the precision of LiDAR-volume equations was relatively insensitive to reductions in pulse density and plot size when an accurate DTM was available. Acquisition of LiDAR information at lower pulse densities is likely to markedly improve the cost efficacy of this information for inventory purposes},

Most of this expansion will occur in the Antarctic Peninsula, where a threefold increase in ice-free area could drastically change the availability and connectivity of biodiversity habitat. Isolated ice-free areas will coalesce, and while the effects on biodiversity are uncertain, we hypothesize that they could eventually lead to increasing regional-scale biotic homogenization, the extinction of less-competitive species and the spread of invasive species.},

abstract = {Accurate and timely estimation of forest structural parameters plays a key role in the management of forest resources, as well as studies on the carbon cycle and biodiversity. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a promising active remote sensing technology capable of providing highly accurate three dimensional and wall-to-wall forest structural characteristics. In this study, we evaluated the utility of standard metrics and canopy metrics derived from airborne LiDAR data for estimating plot-level forest structural parameters individually and in combination, over a subtropical forest in Yushan forest farm, southeastern China. Standard metrics, i.e., height-based and density-based metrics, and canopy metrics extracted from canopy vertical profiles, i.e., canopy volume profile (CVP), canopy height distribution (CHD), and foliage profile (FP), were extracted from LiDAR point clouds. Then the standard metrics and canopy metrics were used for estimating forest structural parameters individually and in combination by multiple regression models, including forest type-specific (coniferous forest, broad-leaved forest, mixed forest) models and general models. Additionally, the synergy of standard metrics and canopy metrics for estimating structural parameters was evaluated using field measured data. Finally, the sensitivity of vertical and horizontal resolution of voxel size for estimating forest structural parameters was assessed. The results showed that, in general, the accuracies of forest type-specific models (Adj-R2 = 0.44–0.88) were relatively higher than general models (Adj-R2 = 0.39–0.77). For forest structural parameters, the estimation accuracies of Lorey's mean height (Adj-R2 = 0.61–0.88) and aboveground biomass (Adj-R2 = 0.54–0.81) models were the highest, followed by volume (Adj-R2 = 0.42–0.78), DBH (Adj-R2 = 0.48–0.74), basal area (Adj-R2 = 0.41–0.69), whereas stem density (Adj-R2 = 0.39–0.64) models were relatively lower. The combination models (Adj-R2 = 0.45–0.88) had higher performance compared with models developed using standard metrics (only) (Adj-R2 = 0.42–0.84) and canopy metrics (only) (Adj-R2 = 0.39–0.83). The results also demonstrated that the optimal voxel size was 5 × 5 × 0.5 m3 for estimating most of the parameters. This study demonstrated that canopy metrics based on canopy vertical profiles can be effectively used to enhance the estimation accuracies of forest structural parameters in subtropical forests.},

abstract = {In the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, three large, permanently ice-covered, closed-basin lakes exist along the floor of Taylor Valley. Lake ice ablation (loss of ice mass) is calculated as the sum of sublimation and surface melt, and is the driver of ice-cover turnover in these systems. In Taylor Valley, both manual and automated lake ice ablation rates have been calculated from 2001 to 2011. Results indicate relatively consistent winter ablation of 0.07–0.21 m (0.2–0.7 mm w.e.d–1). Summer ablation of lake ice is more variable and ranges from 0.25 to 1.62 m (5–31 mm w.e.d–1) over an average 51 day period. Previous to this study, ablation rates have been cited as 0.35 m a–1 in the dry valleys from sublimation modeling based on meteorological variables. We show that this value has significantly underestimated mean ablation and ice-cover turnover on the Taylor Valley lakes.},

@article{Beets2012,
abstract = {New Zealand has implemented its Land Use and Carbon Analysis System (LUCAS) to meet its reporting commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on carbon stock changes related to forests. A double sample design using airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and ground plots has been used for its recent national inventory of carbon stocks in planted forests that were established prior to 1990, using the experience gained with LiDAR from an earlier inventory of the post-1989 planted forests. For the pre-1990 inventory, ground-based, 0.06hectare circular permanent sample plots were installed on an 8×8km grid, with LiDAR flown in North–South transects across only those forests that contain a ground plot. LiDAR metrics were extracted for up to four 0.06ha circular cells spaced at 1km intervals either side of the ground plot and another cell over the ground location. Effectively, LiDAR data were collected on an incomplete 8×1km grid, where individual forests have an unequal probability of being included in the sample. This paper describes the inventory design, those features of the plot measurement protocols that differ from the earlier inventory and the methods to calculate means and variances. Carbon stocks in each of the above- and below-ground live biomass, dead wood and litter pools were calculated for each ground plot at the time of measurement and predicted into the past and future using the Forest Carbon Predictor system. Field measurements of woody debris and litter are laborious and error prone when there has been a silvicultural operation and decay of residues. Given standing tree measurements and a description of past silviculture, the carbon stocks in the woody debris and litter pools are most efficiently estimated by the system rather than measured directly. The LiDAR data were used with regression estimators that explained 80{\%} of the variance in total carbon, where the height percentile P40ht was the best variable. The combination of 686 LiDAR-only plots with a further 191 LiDAR/ground measured plots reduced the confidence interval to 11.1{\%} of the mean total carbon stock per hectare from 14.1{\%} using ground plots only. It had the advantage of being easier and faster to implement than an inventory with the increased number of ground plots required for an equivalent level of precision. A standard double sampling procedure with LiDAR plots on the complete 8×1km grid would have required lengthy flying and been too costly.},

The study objective was to use 15N tracer to quantify pasture N uptake in the ‘wetted' and periphery areas of a spring deposited bovine urine patch over 311 days. Ruminant 15N enriched urine was applied to soil creating a circular wetted area, ‘zone A' (800 kg N ha−1), with and without urea fertiliser (35 kg N ha−1). Pasture yields, 15N recovery and soil inorganic-N dynamics were monitored from zone A and two peripheral zones, B and C. Fertiliser had no effect on cumulative urinary 15N recovery in pasture (50{\%}–52{\%}). Average cumulative pasture 15N recovery in zones A, B and C were 30.6{\%}, 17.3{\%} and 4.2{\%}, respectively. Soil inorganic-15N recovery occurred in zones A and B, declining with distance from the wetted area. The results suggest an effective urine patch area of 0.95 m2 or 3.4 times the wetted area.},

abstract = {Urine patches within pasture soils are hotspots for nitrogen (N) cycling and losses, where nitrification inhibitors (NI) offer a means of reducing such losses. Within urine influenced soil, more research has been conducted for dicyandiamide (DCD) than 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP). Differences in the efficacy of these NI are often ascribed to a greater mobility of DCD, which may lead to spatial separation from NH4+ and nitrifying microorganisms. We tested the mobility of 14C-labelled DCD and DMPP relative to sheep urine-derived NH4+ in soil columns of contrasting texture and organic matter content, following simulated rainfall. We also assessed factors influencing the vertical mobility of these NI in soils, including solubility, sorption/desorption processes and microbial degradation and uptake. Following 40-mm rainfall, without the presence of sheep urine, the distribution of both NI were similar in the soil columns; however, there was a greater retention of DCD compared to DMPP in the top 1 cm. Both NI appeared to co-locate well with urine-derived NH4+, and the presence of sheep urine altered the leaching profile of the NI (compared to rainfall application alone), but this effect was inhibitor and soil-type dependent. A greater sorption to the soil matrix was observed for DCD in comparison to DMPP in all three studied soils, and the presence of urine generally increased desorption processes. Of the NI applied to the soil columns, 18–66 {\%} was taken up within 30 min by the microbial community. However, only small amounts ({\textless}1 {\%}) were mineralized during this period. In conclusion, due to the greater adsorption of DCD as opposed to DMPP and similarity in the degree of co-location of both NI with urine NH4+, the results of this study suggest that differences in microbial uptake and degradation may be more important parameters for explaining differences in the efficacy of reducing nitrification. Further work is required to determine the comparative efficacy of both NI in reducing nitrification rates under field conditions in a range of soil types and environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Abstract Sodium fluorescein (SF) was evaluated and validated as an internal marker in cattle for the location of urine patches in pastures. Three trials were carried out aiming at the following: evaluating the effect of dilution and volume of application on SF fluorescence on the environment; testing dosages and duration of excretion of SF administered orally to cattle; and validating the methodology for SF use on the location of cattle urine patches in pastures. The marker was tested in beef cattle kept on pastures under three grazing systems: degraded pasture under extensive management (De), intensively managed dryland pasture with high stocking rate (Id) and intensively managed irrigated pasture with high stocking rate (Ii). Besides the localization of urination sites, the number of urinations/animal/d and the area covered by urine were also determined. The residue of SF remained fluorescent in the pasture foliage up to 34 h after urination events, allowing the location of urine patches by a black-light flashlight. There was no difference between grazing systems in the number of urine patches/animal/d during the rainy and dry seasons. The average number of urine patches was approximately 11/animal/d. As expected, the estimated volume and area covered by urine varied according to the stocking density. The chosen SF dose (50 mg kg−1 LW) did not adversely affect the animals when administered once daily during 2 d. However, the same SF dose administered during four consecutive days caused urinary disorder in the animal. The distribution of urine patches was spatially dependent on specific characteristics of the paddock.},

The method relies on an initial position obtained with a recreational-grade GPS receiver, in addition to analysis of the ALS and TLS data. First, individual tree positions were derived from the remote-sensing data. A search algorithm was then used to find the best match for the TLS-derived trees among the ALS-derived trees within a search area, defined relative to the initial position. The accuracy of co-registration was assessed by comparison with an accurately measured reference position. With a search radius of 25 m and using low-density ALS data (0.7 points m?2), 82{\%} and 51{\%} of the TLS scans were co-registered with positional errors within 1 m and 0.5 m, respectively. By using ALS data of medium density (7.5 points m?2), 87{\%} and 78{\%} of the scans were co-registered with errors within 1 m and 0.5 m of the reference position, respectively. These results are promising and the method can facilitate rapid acquisition and geo-referencing of field data.

The method relies on an initial position obtained with a recreational-grade GPS receiver, in addition to analysis of the ALS and TLS data. First, individual tree positions were derived from the remote-sensing data. A search algorithm was then used to find the best match for the TLS-derived trees among the ALS-derived trees within a search area, defined relative to the initial position. The accuracy of co-registration was assessed by comparison with an accurately measured reference position. With a search radius of 25 m and using low-density ALS data (0.7 points m?2), 82{\%} and 51{\%} of the TLS scans were co-registered with positional errors within 1 m and 0.5 m, respectively. By using ALS data of medium density (7.5 points m?2), 87{\%} and 78{\%} of the scans were co-registered with errors within 1 m and 0.5 m of the reference position, respectively. These results are promising and the method can facilitate rapid acquisition and geo-referencing of field data. Robust methods to identify and handle erroneous matches are, however, required before it is suitable for operational use.},

There have been several iterations and AGDC version 2 is a major advance on previous work. The foundations and core components of the AGDC are: (1) data preparation, including geometric and radiometric corrections to Earth observation data to produce standardised surface reflectance measurements that support time-series analysis, and collection management systems which track the provenance of each Data Cube product and formalise re-processing decisions; (2) the software environment used to manage and interact with the data; and (3) the supporting high performance computing environment provided by the Australian National Computational Infrastructure (NCI).A growing number of examples demonstrate that our data cube approach allows analysts to extract rich new information from Earth observation time series, including through new methods that draw on the full spatial and temporal coverage of the Earth observation archives. To enable easy-uptake of the AGDC, and to facilitate future cooperative development, our code is developed under an open-source, Apache License, Version 2.0. This open-source approach is enabling other organisations, including the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites (CEOS), to explore the use of similar data cubes in developing countries.},

abstract = {[1] Multidecadal meteorological station records and microwave backscatter time-series from the SeaWinds scatterometer onboard QuikSCAT (QSCAT) were used to calculate temporal and spatial trends in surface melting conditions on the Antarctic Peninsula (AP). Four of six long-term station records showed strongly positive and statistically significant trends in duration of melting conditions, including a 95{\%} increase in the average annual positive degree day sum (PDD) at Faraday/Vernadsky, since 1948. A validated, threshold-based melt detection method was employed to derive detailed melt season onset, extent, and duration climatologies on the AP from enhanced resolution QSCAT data during 1999–2009. Austral summer melt on the AP was linked to regional-and synoptic-scale atmospheric variability by respectively correlating melt season onset and extent with November near-surface air temperatures and the October–January averaged index of the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode (SAM). The spatial pattern, magnitude, and interannual variability of AP melt from observations was closely reproduced by simulations of the regional model RACMO2. Local discrepancies between observations and model simulations were likely a result of the QSCAT response to, and RACMO2 treatment of, ponded surface water, and the relatively crude representation of coastal climate in the 27 km RACMO2 grid.},

abstract = {Nitrate (NO3−) leaching and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from urine patches in grazed pastures are key sources of water and air pollution, respectively. Numerous studies have demonstrated that broadcast application of the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) can abate such losses of reactive nitrogen (N). This research explored an alternative usage of DCD. It is the first field study that investigates the feeding of powdered DCD mixed with several typical cattle feeds as a practical and effective method to deliver a nitrification inhibitor to urine patches. DCD (in its dry powdered form) was manually mixed with three typical dairy cow feed types (barley concentrate, maize silage or grass silage) before being fed to the cattle in a Latin Square design experiment. DCD delivery to the small area covered by urine patches during grazing events was then measured as a DCD equivalent application rate (in kg DCD ha−1). The absence of a significant feed type effect (P {\textgreater} 0.1) on the urine patch DCD equivalent application rate suggests that the ingestion of any of the three supplementary feeds mixed with DCD should be similarly effective at delivering DCD to urine patches, despite the potential differences in aspects of feed digestibility and the impact on rumen pH and rate of DCD passage through the rumen. Importantly, there was a highly significant positive relationship (P ≤ 0.0001) between excreted DCD and N in urine and urine patches, which meant that the deposition rate of DCD matched the urinary N inputs in urine patches. Additionally, less total DCD was needed than is required with broadcast application. Added to the fact that DCD and urinary N are both deposited at the same time and intimately mixed in urine patches, feeding DCD to dairy cows after mixing with different feeds could represent a more effective and practical DCD application strategy than a DCD broadcast application at a single rate.},

abstract = {Data provenance and detailed technical documentation are essential components of high-quality reproducible research, however are often only partially addressed during a research project. Recording and maintaining this information during the course of a project can be a difficult task to get right as it is a time consuming and often boring process for the researchers involved. As a result, provenance records and technical documentation provided alongside research results can be incomplete or may not be completely consistent with the actual processes followed. While providing access to the data and code used by the original researchers goes some way toward enabling reproducibility, this does not count as, or replace, data provenance. Additionally, this can be a poor substitute for good technical documentation and is often more difficult for a third-party to understand – particularly if they do not understand the programming language(s) used. We present and discuss a tool built from the ground up for the production of well-documented and reproducible spatial datasets that are created by applying a series of classification rules to a number of input layers. The internal model of the classification rules required by the tool to process the input data is exploited to also produce technical documentation and provenance records with minimal additional user input. Available provenance records that accompany input datasets are incorporated into those that describe the current process. As a result, each time a new iteration of the analysis is performed the documentation and provenance records are re-generated to provide an accurate description of the exact process followed. The generic nature of this tool, and the lessons learned during its creation, have wider application to other fields where the production of derivative datasets must be done in an open, defensible, and reproducible way.},

Utilizing high scan quality data as the input, the resulting models describe the branching structure of the tree, capable of detecting branches with a diameter smaller than a centimeter. The cylinders are stored as a hierarchical tree-like data structure encapsulating parent-child neighbor relations and incorporating the tree's direction of growth. This structure enables the efficient extraction of tree components, such as the stem or a single branch. The method was validated both by applying a comparison of the resulting cylinder models with ground truth data and by an analysis between the input point clouds and the models. Tree models were accomplished representing more than 99{\%} of the input point cloud, with an average distance from the cylinder model to the point cloud within sub-millimeter accuracy. After validation, the method was applied to build two allometric models based on 24 tree point clouds as an example of the application. Computation terminated successfully within less than 30 min. For the model predicting the total above ground volume, the coefficient of determination was 0.965, showing the high potential of terrestrial laser-scanning for forest inventories.[12pt]},

abstract = {New Zealand dairy farmers are facing increasing pressure to reduce nutrient losses from grazing ruminants to the environment. Research suggests that the major source of nutrient loss is animal excreta which, for nitrogen (N), relates to cattle urine in particular. Most models used to describe N cycling and predict loss assume homogeneous distribution of urine patches across grazing areas. This study aims to provide baseline knowledge of the temporal and spatial distribution of N by monitoring the urination behaviour of individual dairy cows on a commercial farm using remote precision tools. The study took place on No 4 Dairy Farm, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand during early autumn in March 2009. Thirty cows in late lactation, balanced for milking order and age, from a herd of 180 milking cows, were fitted with global positioning system collars and urine sensors for seven consecutive days. The herd was milked twice a day and rotationally grazed, without supplementation. Cows were rotated through 12 paddocks, each {\~{}}1.1 ha. The majority of urine (85 {\%} of total) was deposited on pasture, while 10 {\%} of total urine deposits were captured in the holding yard and milking shed. Kernel density estimates indicated that urine patch distribution was not homogeneous, thus there was aggregation of urine patches within particular areas of the paddocks. Moderate correlations between the time spent in a location and urine patch density provided evidence that the time spent in a particular location was a factor affecting the density of urine patches. Substantial variation in results between paddocks suggested that paddock characteristics did not play a major role in determining urine distribution patterns in this study.},

abstract = {In ecological analyses of species and community distributions there is interest in the nature of their responses to environmental gradients and in identifying the most important environmental variables, which may be used for predicting patterns of biodiversity. Methods such as random forests already exist to assess predictor importance for individual species and to indicate where along gradients abundance changes. However, there is a need to extend these methods to whole assemblages, to establish where along the range of these gradients the important compositional changes occur, and to identify any important thresholds or change points. We develop such a method, called "gradient forest," which is an extension of the random forest approach. By synthesizing the cross-validated R2 and accuracy importance measures from univariate random forest analyses across multiple species, sampling devices, and surveys, gradient forest obtains a monotonic function of each predictor that represents the compositional turnover along the gradient of the predictor. When applied to a synthetic data set, the method correctly identified the important predictors and delineated where the compositional change points occurred along these gradients. Application of gradient forest to a real data set from part of the Great Barrier Reef identified mud fraction of the sediment as the most important predictor, with highest compositional turnover occurring at mud fraction values around 25{\%}, and provided similar information for other predictors. Such refined information allows for more accurate capturing of biodiversity patterns for the purposes of bioregionalization, delineation of protected areas, or designing of biodiversity surveys.},

Climate models generally predict amplified warming in polar regions, as observed in Antarctica's peninsula region over the second half of the 20th century. Although previous reports suggest slight recent continental warming, our spatial analysis of Antarctic meteorological data demonstrates a net cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000, particularly during summer and autumn. The McMurdo Dry Valleys have cooled by 0.7 degrees C per decade between 1986 and 2000, with similar pronounced seasonal trends. Summer cooling is particularly important to Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems that are poised at the interface of ice and water. Here we present data from the dry valleys representing evidence of rapid terrestrial ecosystem response to climate cooling in Antarctica, including decreased primary productivity of lakes (6-9{\%} per year) and declining numbers of soil invertebrates (more than 10{\%} per year). Continental Antarctic cooling, especially the seasonality of cooling, poses challenges to models of climate and ecosystem change.},

abstract = {Characterization of tropical forest trees has been limited to field-based techniques focused on measurement of diameter of the cylindrical part of the bole, with large uncertainty in measuring large treeswith irregular shapes, and other size attributes such as total tree height and the crown size. Here, we introduce a methodology to decompose lidar point cloud data into 3D clusters corresponding to individual tree crowns (ITC) that enables the estimation of many biophysical variables of tropical forests such as tree height, crown area, crown volume, and tree number density. The ITC-based approach was tested using airborne high-resolution lidar data collected over the 50-ha Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) plot in the Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The lack of tree height and crown size measurements in the field prohibits the direct validation of the ITC metrics. We assess the reliability of our method by comparing the aboveground biomass (AGB) estimated using ground and lidar individual tree measurements at multiple spatial scales, namely 1ha, 2.25 ha, 4ha, and 6.25 ha. We examined four different lidar-derived AGB models, with three based on individual tree height, crown volume, and crown area, and one with mean top canopy height (TCH) calculated at the plot level using the lidar canopy height model. Results show that the predictive power of all models based on ITC size and TCH increases with decreasing spatial resolution from16.9{\%} at 1ha for theworst model to 5.0{\%} at 6.25ha for the best model. The TCH-based model performed slightly better than ITC-based models except at higher spatial scales ({\~{}}4 ha) and when errors due to edge effects associated with tree crowns were reduced. Unlike the TCH models that change regionally depending on forest type and structure allometry, the ITC-based models are derived as a function of individual tree allometry and can be extended globally to all tropical forests. The method for lidar detection of individual crown size overcome some limitations of ground-based inventories such as 1) it is able to access crowns of large trees and 2) it enables the assessment of directional changes in tree density, canopy architecture and forest dynamics over large and inaccessible areas to support robust tropical ecological studies.},

In tree classification, first, a waveform representation is developed to model geometric structures of trees. Then, deep learning techniques are used to generate high-level feature abstractions of the trees' waveform representations. Quantitative analysis shows that our algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 86.1{\%} and a kappa coefficient of 0.8 in classifying urban tree species using mobile LiDAR data.

abstract = {We developed a new algorithm called Tmask (multiTemporal mask) for automated masking of cloud, cloud shadow, and snow for multitemporal Landsat images. This algorithm consists of two steps. The first step is based on a single-date algorithm called Fmask (Function of mask) that initially screens most of the clouds, cloud shadows, and snow. The second step benefits from the extra temporal information from the remaining "clear" pixels and further improves the cloud, cloud shadow, and snow mask. Three Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance bands (Bands 2, 4, and 5 - Landsat-7 band numbering) are used in a Robust Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (RIRLS) method to estimate a time series model for each pixel. By comparing model estimates with Landsat observations for the three spectral bands, the Tmask algorithm is capable of detecting any remaining clouds, cloud shadows, and snow for an entire stack of Landsat images. Generally, this algorithm will not falsely identify land cover changes as clouds, cloud shadows, or snow, as it is capable of modeling land cover change. The multitemporal images also provide extra information for better discrimination of cloud and snow, which is difficult for single-date algorithm. A snow threshold is derived for Band 5 TOA reflectance for each pixel at each specific time based on a modified Norwegian Linear Reflectance-to-Snow-Cover (NLR) algorithm. By comparing the results of Tmask with a single-date algorithm (Fmask) for multitemporal Landsat images located at Path 12 Row 31, significant improvements are observed for identification of clouds, cloud shadows, and snow. The most significant improvement is observed for cloud shadow detection. Many of the errors in cloud, cloud shadow, and snow detection observed in Fmask are corrected by the Tmask algorithm. The goal is development of a cloud, cloud shadow, and snow detection algorithm that results in a multitemporal stack of images that is free of "noise" factors and thus suitable for detection of land cover change. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The surface wind regime of the Ross Ice Shelf (RIS) is dominated by northward outflow influenced by drainage from both East and West Antarctica and synoptic disturbances over the Ross Sea. To quantify the effects of the wind regime on the climate of the region, we produce a synoptic climatology of the RIS and Ross Sea via a k -means clustering technique applied to surface (10 m) winds from the ERA Interim reanalysis (1979–2011). We describe the generation of the climatology and discuss composites of surface winds, mean sea-level pressure and temperature, which show a high degree of internally consistent structure and are similar to previous synoptic climatologies. While some small-scale features are not fully resolved by the reanalysis, such as the channelling of katabatic flows, we identify a high degree of coherence between clustering results and available in situ data sources, suggesting that the ERA Interim represents the region well. We find that the surface wind field of the ice shelf is highly sensitive to the strength and position of cyclonic disturbances in the Ross Sea, the presence of which can aid outflow from the continental interior. Temperature displays a high level of sensitivity to circulation conditions due to the effects of steep temperature gradients surrounding the shelf and advective heat transport. Cold temperatures on the ice shelf coincide with drainage from East Antarctica, while warmer periods coincide with West Antarctic drainage; this is particularly clear during RIS air stream (RAS) events. The warmest periods occur during southward transport from the Ross Sea. The sensitivity of temperature to the origin of flows suggests circulation changes in the region are likely to significantly impact surface climate. Analysis of the frequency of varying synoptic events and their persistence confirms RAS is a very common and persistent feature of the region.},

abstract = {Extracting 3D tree models based on terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point clouds is a challenging task as trees are complex objects. Current TLS devices acquire high-density data that allow a detailed reconstruction of the tree topology. However, in dense forests a fully automatic reconstruction of trees is often limited by occlusion, wind influences and co-registration issues. In this paper, a semi-automatic method for extracting branching and stem structure based on equirectangular projections (range and intensity maps) is presented. The digitization of branches and stems is based on 2D maps, which enables simple navigation and raster processing. The modeling is performed for each viewpoint individually instead of using a registered point cloud. Previously reconstructed 2D-skeletons are transformed between the maps. Therefore, wind influences, orientation imperfections of scans and data gaps can be overcome. The method is applied to a TLS dataset acquired in a forest in Germany. In total 34 scans were carried out within a managed forest to measure approximately 90 spruce trees with minimal occlusions. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the presented approach to extract tree models with a high completeness and correctness and provide an excellent input for further modeling applications.},

Identification of urine patches could reduce N losses in grazed pastures through more efficient fertilizer application and improved fertilizer N use efficiency (NUE). The aim of this study was to determine if remote sensing using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology could accurately identify urine patches in grazed pastures based on height variation of the grass canopy in close proximity. Synthetic cow urine (7 g N L−1) was applied to two blocks (20 m × 20 m) in a well-established pasture in Canterbury, New Zealand, which had no recent exposure to grazing animals or N fertilization. Urine patches were scanned weekly for five weeks. LiDAR based contour maps of the pasture were shown to accurately detect the asymmetric urine patches as well as calculate a percent area of urine based high N as early as one week after a simulated grazing event.},

The goal of this study is to develop methods for detecting and discriminating individual trees from TLS point clouds of five plots in a boreal coniferous forest. The proposed hierarchical minimum cut method adopts the detected trunk points that are recognized according to pole like shape segmentation as foreground seed points and other points as background seed points, respectively. It constructs the undirected weighted graph of the foreground and background seed points to deduce a cost function for tree crown point segmentation with the decreasing ranking of tree trunk heights. The intermediate results lead to global optimization segmentation of individual trees in a hierarchical order. Finally, the structure metrics of the detected individual trees are calculated and checked with field observations. Plots with different attributes were selected to verify the proposed method, and the experimental studies show that the proposed method is efficient and robust for extracting individual trees from TLS point clouds in terms of the recall of 90.42{\%}.},

abstract = {Climate models predict Antarctic precipitation to increase during the 21st century, but their present day Antarctic precipitation differs. A model-independent climatology of the Antarctic precipitation characteristics, such as snowfall rates and frequency, is needed to assess the models, but it is not yet available. Satellite observations of precipitation by active sensors has been possible in the polar regions since the launch of CloudSat in 2006. Here, we use two CloudSat products to generate the first multi-year, model-independent climatology of Antarctic precipitation. The first product is used to determine the frequency and the phase of precipitation, while the second product is used to assess the snowfall rate. The mean snowfall rate from August 2006 to April 2011 is 171 mm year−1 over the Antarctic ice sheet, north of 82° S. While uncertainties on individual precipitation retrievals from CloudSat data are potentially large, the mean uncertainty should be much smaller, but cannot be easily estimated. There are no in situ measurements of Antarctic precipitation to directly assess the new climatology. However, distributions of both precipitation occurrences and rates generally agree with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim data set, the production of which is constrained by various in situ and satellite observations, but does not use any data from CloudSat. The new data set thus offers unprecedented capability to quantitatively assess Antarctic precipitation statistics and rates in climate models.},

abstract = {Snowfall was measured at II sites in the McMurdo Dry Valleys to determine its magnitude, its temporal changes, and spatial patterns. Annual values ranged from 3 to 50 mm water equivalent with the highest values nearest the coast and decreasing inland. A particularly strong spatial gradient exists in Taylor Valley, probably resulting from local uplift conditions at the coastal margin and valley topography that limits migration inland. More snow occurs in winter near the coast, whereas inland no seasonal pattern is discernable. This may be due, again, to local uplift conditions, which are common in winter. We find no influence of the distance to the sea ice edge. Katabatic winds play an important role in transporting snow to the valley bottoms and essentially double the precipitation. That much of the snow accumulation sublimates prior to making a hydrologic contribution underscores the notion that the McMurdo Dry Valleys are indeed an extreme polar desert.

abstract = {The use of Landsat data to answer ecological questions is greatly increased by the effective removal of cloud and cloud shadow from satellite images. We develop a novel algorithm to identify and classify clouds and cloud shadow, SPARCS: Spatial Procedures for Automated Removal of Cloud and Shadow. The method uses a neural network approach to determine cloud, cloud shadow, water, snow/ice and clear sky classification memberships of each pixel in a Landsat scene. It then applies a series of spatial procedures to resolve pixels with ambiguous membership by using information, such as the membership values of neighboring pixels and an estimate of cloud shadow locations from cloud and solar geometry. In a comparison with FMask, a high-quality cloud and cloud shadow classification algorithm currently available, SPARCS performs favorably, with substantially lower omission errors for cloud shadow (8.0{\%} and 3.2{\%}), only slightly higher omission errors for clouds (0.9{\%} and 1.3{\%}, respectively) and fewer errors of commission (2.6{\%} and 0.3{\%}). Additionally, SPARCS provides a measure of uncertainty in its classification that can be exploited by other algorithms that require clear sky pixels. To illustrate this, we present an application that constructs obstruction-free composites of images acquired on different dates in support of a method for vegetation change detection.},

abstract = {Accurate estimates of vegetation structure are important for a large number of applications including ecological modeling and carbon budgets. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) measures the three-dimensional structure of vegetation using laser beams. Most LiDAR applications today rely on airborne platforms for data acquisitions, which typically record between 1 and 5 "discrete" returns for each outgoing laser pulse. Although airborne LiDAR allows sampling of canopy characteristics at stand and landscape level scales, this method is largely insensitive to below canopy biomass, such as understorey and trunk volumes, as these elements are often occluded by the upper parts of the crown, especially in denser canopies. As a supplement to airborne laser scanning (ALS), a number of recent studies used terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) for the biomass estimation in spatially confined areas. One such instrument is the Echidna {\textregistered} Validation Instrument (EVI), which is configured to fully digitize the returned energy of an emitted laser pulse to establish a complete profile of the observed vegetation elements. In this study we assess and compare a number of canopy metrics derived from airborne and TLS. Three different experiments were conducted using discrete return ALS data and discrete and full waveform observations derived from the EVI. Although considerable differences were found in the return distribution of both systems, ALS and TLS were both able to accurately determine canopy height ($\Delta$ height {\textless} 2.5 m) and the vertical distribution of foliage and leaf area (0.86 {\textgreater} r 2 {\textgreater} 0.90, p {\textless} 0.01). When using more spatially explicit approaches for modeling the biomass and volume throughout the stands, the differences between ALS and TLS observations were more distinct; however, predictable patterns exist based on sensor position and configuration. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Tree species classification accuracy at the individual tree crown (ITC) level depends on many factors, among which in this paper we analyzed: i) the remote sensing data used for the ITC delineation process carried out prior to the classification, and ii) the pixels considered inside each ITC during the classification process. These two factors were analyzed on the ITC level classification accuracy of boreal tree species (Pine, Spruce and Broadleaves), considering two remote sensing data types: hyperspectral and airborne laser scanning (ALS). ITCs were delineated automatically on ALS and on hyperspectral data. A manual ITC delineation was used as reference in the analysis. The pixel level classification was performed on the hyperspectral bands using a non-linear support vector machine. The classification at ITC level was obtained by applying a majority voting rule to the classified pixels confined by each ITC. The results showed that ITCs automatically delineated from hyperspectral data were usually smaller than those from ALS, and the tree detection rate for hyperspectral data was much lower compared to ALS data (28.4 versus 48.5{\%}). Regarding the classification results, using only manually delineated ITCs a kappa accuracy of 0.89 was obtained, while using only automatically delineated ITCs from hyperspectral or ALS data reduced the kappa values to 0.79 and 0.76, respectively. Slightly different results were achieved using semi-automatic approaches based on both manual and automatically delineated ITC (0.81 and 0.74, respectively). A selection of only certain pixels inside each ITC improved the classification accuracy from 1 to 7 percentage points. A selection based on the spectral values of the pixels was found more influential than the one based on the ALS-derived canopy height model. The best results were obtained after a selection based on the spectral values in the bands in the blue region of the spectrum using either the Otsu method or an ad-hoc percentile-based thresholding method. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Nutrient losses from grazed pasture are an important non-point source of water pollution. The distribution of animal urine patches on pasture is an important factor in determining nitrate losses and influencing pasture growth, nutritive value and pasture acceptability to livestock, as a high amount of nitrogen (N) is deposited onto a small area of soil under a urine patch. Urine distribution may be recorded during or post-grazing. Measurements during grazing have been automated, but post-grazing measurement currently relies on manual observations that are time consuming and cannot be subsequently verified. To automate post-grazing measurements, aerial photographs were taken of grazed pasture approximately 14d post-grazing using a standard digital camera. Pasture response areas were successfully identified by analysing the hue of the images using readily available software, yielding comparable results to manual counts. The majority of dung patches did not produce observable pasture responses, with only 14{\%} of the visible response areas being associated with dung, so although this method cannot distinguish between urine and dung response areas, it is primarily influenced by urine. Provided photographs are taken in full sunlight with a high-quality camera, excreta patch numbers, areas and spatial distribution can be measured with a high degree of precision. Furthermore, the method is relatively inexpensive and applicable to a wide range of situations. A permanent photographic record of the pasture is also established, which allows verification of the analysis in future.},

In this article, we quantify the modulating effect of this feature on winds over the Ross Sea and Ross Ice Shelf. We examine composites of surface winds sampled according to extrema in ASL depth, longitude, and latitude. We employ the output of a previously developed synoptic climatology to identify the explanatory synoptic-scale forcings. In autumn, winter, and spring (AWS) we find that the impact of the depth of the ASL is smaller than that of its location. The ASL moves eastward when it is deep, thereby reducing its influence on Ross Sea winds. When the ASL is northward, we find strongly enhanced southerly flows over the Ross Sea and Ice Shelf, forced by greater cyclonic activity in the north of the Ross Sea. In summer, we find increased cyclonic flow coinciding with a deeper ASL, despite the ASL being located in the Bellingshausen Sea at this time. The responses to the ASL longitude and latitude are profoundly different to those in AWS, suggesting that relationships are strongly dependent on the varying seasonal location of the low. We examine two metrics of the ASL depth and identify that the absolute mean sea level pressure (MSLP) has a more widespread response than that of the relative MSLP.},

abstract = {The Ad{\'{e}}lie Land coastal region of Antarctica is one of the most prominent cyclogenesis regions in the Southern Hemisphere, and is adjacent to the continent's most intense katabatic wind regime. However, the physical mechanisms responsible for cyclogenesis are not known. A manual analysis of cyclogenesis for the 2003-2005 period using output from the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) identifies two primary patterns of cyclogenesis near the Ad{\'{e}}lie Land coast. For "secondary development" cyclones, enhanced low-level cyclonic vorticity and baroclinicity result from the combination of an existing synoptic-scale cyclone to the west, coastal barrier winds and katabatic winds. "Lee cyclogenesis" occurs near 152°E on the cyclonic-shear side of the Ad{\'{e}}lie Land katabatic jet, where a low-level warm potential temperature anomaly sets up a lee trough that becomes mobile with the arrival of upper-level synoptic-scale forcing. The representation of both "secondary development" and "lee cyclogenesis" cyclones in an automated cyclone-tracking scheme is explored, where it is found that the automated scheme overestimates cyclogenesis for this region. The location of the Antarctic coastal cyclogenesis maximum near Ad{\'{e}}lie Land is due to the unique juxtaposition of the extraordinary katabatic wind regime and dissipating synoptic-scale cyclones to the west. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Tellus A {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons A/S.},

In the field, 438 urban trees located in park and forested environments were measured and mapped from our study area located in Seurasaari, Helsinki, Finland. A field reference was collected, using a tree map created manually from TLS data. The tree detection rate and location accuracy were evaluated, using automatic or semiautomatic ALS individual tree detection (ALSITDauto or ALSITDvisual) and manual or automatic measurements of TLS and MLS (TLSauto, MLSauto, MLSmanual, MLSsemi). Our results showed that the best methods for tree detection were TLSauto and MLSmanual, which detected 73.29{\%} and 79.22{\%} of the reference trees, respectively. The location accuracies (RMSE) varied between 0.44m and 1.57m; the methods listed from the most accurate to most inaccurate were MLSsemi, TLSauto, MLSmanual, MLSauto, ALSITDauto and ALSITDvisual. We conclude that the accuracies of TLS and ALS were applicable for operational urban tree mapping in heterogeneous park forests. MLSmanual shows high potential but manual measurements are not feasible in operational tree mapping. Challenges that should be solved in further studies include ALSITDauto oversegmentation as well as MLSauto processing methodologies and data collection for tree detection. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {Accurate field data on the paddock area affected by cow urine depositions are critical to the estimation and modelling of nitrogen (N) losses and N management in grazed pasture systems. A new technique using survey-grade global positioning system (GPS) technology was developed to precisely measure the paddock spatial area coverage, diversity and distribution of dairy cattle urine patches in grazed paddocks over time. A 4-year study was conducted on the Lincoln University Dairy Farm (LUDF), Canterbury, New Zealand, from 2003 to 2007. Twelve field plots, each 100 m 2 in area, were established on typical grazing areas of the farm. All urine and dung deposits within the plots were visually identified, the pasture response area (radius) measured and position marked with survey-grade GPS. The plots were grazed as part of the normal grazing rotation of the farm and urine and dung deposits measured at 12-week intervals. The data were collated using spatial (GIS) software and an assessment of annual urine patch coverage and spatial distribution was made. Grazing intensities ranged from 17645 to 30295 cow grazing h/ha/yr. Mean annual areas of urine patches ranged from 0•34 to 0•40 m 2 (4-year mean 0•37±0•009 m 2), with small but significant variation between years and seasons. Mean annual urine patch numbers were 6240±124 patches/ha/yr. The mean proportional area coverage for a single sampling event or season was 0•058 and the mean proportional annual urine patch coverage was 0•232±0•0071. There was a strong linear relationship between annual cow grazing h/ha and urine patch numbers/ha (R 2=0•69) and also annual urine patch area coverage (R 2=0•77). Within the stocking densities observed in this study, an annual increase of 10000 cow grazing h/ha increased urine patch numbers by 1800 urine patches/ha/yr and annual urine patch area coverage by 0•07. This study presents new quantitative data on urine patch size, numbers and the spatial coverage of patches on a temporal basis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {Steephill and mountain slopes severely affect remote sensing of vegeta- tion. The irradiation on a slope varies strongly with slope azimuth relative to the sun, and the reflectance of the slope varies with the angles of incidence and exitance relative to the slope normal. Topographic correction involves standardiz- ing imagery for these two effects. We use an atmospheric model with a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to calculate direct and diffuse illumination, and a simple function of incidence and exitance angles to calculate vegetation-canopy reflectance on terrain slope. The reflectance correction has been derived from the physics of visible direct radiation on a vegetation canopy, but has proved applic- able to infrared wavelengths and only requires solar position, slope and aspect. We applied the reflectance and illumination correction to a SPOT 4 image of New Zealand to remove topographic variation. In all spectral bands, the algorithm markedly reduced the coefficients of variation of vegetation groups on rugged terrain. This produced clean spectral signatures, improving the capacity for auto- mated classification. If illumination correction is performed alone, the coefficients of variation can be increased, and so should not be applied without a reflectance correction. The algorithm output is reflectance on a level surface, enabling the monitoring of vegetation in hilly and mountainous areas.},

abstract = {Urine depositions have been shown to be the main source of N leaching from grazing systems and thus it is important to consider them in simulation models. The inclusion of urine patches considerably increases the complexity of the model and this can be further aggravated if the overlaps of urine patches are also considered. Overlapping urine patches are potentially important sources of N loss because the N load in these areas can be very high. In this work, we investigate a methodology to simplify the process of accounting for overlapping urine patches. We tested a two-stage approach, where, on one hand, the urine of two consecutive depositions could be aggregated and deposited at the time of the second deposition. This was called the Delayed Representation (DR) and would be useful when the delay (Td) between overlaps is short. On the other hand, if Td is sufficiently large, the depositions would become functionally independent and the urine patches could be considered separately. We called this the Independent Representation (IR). We tested this methodology by comparing simulations where the overlapping urine patches were considered explicitly and using the DR or IR in several combination of climates, soils and management options, chosen to span the likely range in New Zealand, using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model.The results from the simulations indicated that when Td {\textless} 20 days, the DR introduced only a low, acceptable, error in simulated N leaching. When Td {\textgreater} 180 days, the IR was found to be acceptable in all the climates, soils and management options simulated. This left a generic window, 20 {\textless} Td {\textless} 180 days, where explicit simulations would be required. In some conditions, that window was considerably shorter. In a dry climate and shallow soil, the window was found to be 75 {\textless} Td {\textless} 180 days, while for the simulations with a wetter climate and deep soils, that window was about 70 {\textless} Td {\textless} 90 days, except for depositions in the middle of winter. These limits should apply only to long-term simulations where the user is interested in the average behaviour of the system, as considerable year-to-year variability was observed. We suggest that these windows can be used to guide the development of simulation models that include representations of urine patches under many conditions but where the soil and/or climate conditions vary markedly from those used here the analysis should be repeated. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Scan-matching is a technique that can be used for building accurate maps and estimating vehicle motion by comparing a sequence of point cloud measurements of the environment taken from a moving sensor. One challenge that arises in mapping applications where the sensor motion is fast relative to the measurement time is that scans become locally distorted and difficult to align. This problem is common when using 3D laser range sensors, which typically require more scanning time than their 2D counterparts. Existing 3D mapping solutions either eliminate sensor motion by taking a {\&}{\#}x201C;stop-and-scan{\&}{\#}x201D; approach, or attempt to correct the motion in an open-loop fashion using odometric or inertial sensors. We propose a solution to 3D scan-matching in which a continuous 6DOF sensor trajectory is recovered to correct the point cloud alignments, producing locally accurate maps and allowing for a reliable estimate of the vehicle motion. Our method is applied to data collected from a 3D spinning lidar sensor mounted on a skid-steer loader vehicle to produce quality maps of outdoor scenes and estimates of the vehicle trajectory during the mapping sequences.},

abstract = {Warm, dry and gusty foehn winds are frequently experienced in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs), Antarctica; however, their significance in the region's climate is unknown. Foehn events in the MDVs are caused by topographic modification of southwesterly airflow which is related to the occurrence of synoptic-scale cyclones in the Amundsen/Ross Sea region. The intra- and interannual frequency and intensity of foehn events therefore varies in response to the position and frequency of cyclones in this region that are believed to be strongly influenced by the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Here, we present a 20-year climatology of foehn winds from observational records in the MDVs. The SAM is found to significantly influence foehn wind frequency during the Antarctic summer and autumn months, whereas ENSO only holds significant correlations with winter air temperatures in the MDVs. The positive relationship between the SAM and the foehn wind regime in summer is particularly significant as foehn winds frequently cause summer temperatures to rise above 0 °C leading to extensive melt and thaw in MDVs. Foehn winds are a major climatological feature of the MDVs with their frequency and duration affecting the region's temperature records and their trends. Accordingly, analysis of the region's weather and climate records and predictions of future impacts of climate change on the MDVs is incomplete without consideration of foehn winds and their influence.

abstract = {Background: A survey was conducted to assess the uptake, and barriers to use, of geospatial tools and technologies amongst New Zealand's plantation forestry sector. Methods: Responses were received from 17 companies representing 63{\%} of New Zealand's plantation forest by area. A wide range of company sizes were surveyed (net stocked areas ranged from 4,000–200,000 hectares), and 7 of the 17 have international operations. Results: Survey results suggest that freely available topography, climate, and soil datasets have limited utility, as forest management at the operational level requires higher resolution, remotely sensed data. The most common supplemental data are aerial photography or satellite imagery. High spatial resolution was more highly valued by respondents than spectral diversity (i.e. number of channels); only six companies regularly use imagery containing an infrared band. LiDAR data has been used regularly by only three New Zealand forestry companies, while another six have tried it, suggesting it is an emerging technology in New Zealand. The use of generic GIS software was common amongst all respondents (14 use the ESRI product ArcGIS, three use MapInfo produced by Pitney Bowes). The utility of ArcGIS, in particular, was enhanced by locally developed extensions designed to address specific operational tasks performed regularly by New Zealand's forestry companies. Conclusions: While it is clear that geospatial data and tools are generally adopted by New Zealand's forest industry, cost-related barriers prevent their widespread adoption. Interestingly, a lack of staff knowledge was also conceded an impediment to uptake, alluding to the importance of tertiary education in the geospatial sciences and continuing education for practitioners},

abstract = {Although its major components have been known almost since the earliest exploring expeditions, even today the terrestrial biota of Antarctica is surprisingly poorly described in detail. It is clear that most currently ice-free ground in Antarctica would have been covered and scoured by glacial advances at the Last Glacial Maximum or previous maxima. Exceptions to this generalisation include parts of the Victoria Land Dry Valleys and some inland nunataks and mountain ranges at altitude, which host their own largely unique biota. However, as new baseline survey data have become available, in combination with the application of techniques of molecular biological analysis, new evidence has been obtained indicating that long-term persistence and regional isolation is a feature of the Antarctic terrestrial biota whose generality has not previously been appreciated. As well as creating a new paradigm in which to consider the evolution and adaptation of Antarctic terrestrial biota, this opens important new cross-disciplinary linkages in the field of understanding the geological and glaciological history of the continent itself. Superimposed on this emerging historical template of Antarctic biogeography, this biota now faces the twin challenges of responding to the complex processes of climate change facing some parts of the continent, and the direct impacts associated with human occupation and travel to and between the spatially very limited areas of terrestrial habitat. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this article we present a method for correcting AVHRR visible and near-infrared imagery for varying satellite and solar zenith angles. This method is based on the WAK BRDF model for closed canopies. The parameters required to perform BRDF correction can be derived from consecutive pass AVHRR imagery pairs. This imagery provides two views of the land surface close together in time but with large differences in phase angle. It is reasonable to assume that both the surface and the atmosphere will change little between orbits, and that after BRDF correction reflectances of given targets should be the same in both orbits. Before BRDF parameters can be fitted, atmospheric correction must be performed. To improve this process, average monthly atmospheric profiles and aerosol optical depths are used as radiative transfer model inputs in conjunction with a digital elevation model. Using atmosphere corrected reflectance data from 12 NOAA-14 AVHRR image pairs, BRDF parameters were extracted for predominant vegetation groups in New Zealand: Indigenous forest; exotic forest; scrub; pasture; and tussock grassland. For each of these vegetation groups significant non-Lambertian reflectance behavior was observed, and BRDF correction using the derived parameters successfully minimized this variation. Measuring the spread of the corrected results from the desired equal reflectance line gives a measure of the accuracy of the method. After correction, the RMS reflectance errors were approximately 0.01 in the visible and 0.02 in the near-infrared. A vegetation map specifying the proportions of the vegetation groups at any given location can be used to perform regular BRDF correction. Reflectance standardization to a fixed view and sun angle can then be performed using the pre-derived BRDF parameters and proportional BRDF correction. ??Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.},

abstract = {Deriving individual tree information from discrete return, small footprint LiDAR data may improve forest aboveground biomass estimates, and provide tree-level information that is important in many ecological studies. Several crown delineation algorithms have been developed to extract individual tree information from LiDAR point clouds or rasterized canopy height models (CHM), but many of these algorithms have difficulty discriminating between overlapping crowns, and also may fail to detect understory trees. Our approach uses a watershed-based delineation of a CHM, which is subsequently refined using the LiDAR point cloud. Individual tree detection was validated with stem mapped field data from the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC), Maryland, and on a plot and stand level through comparisons of stem density and basal area to delineated metrics at both SERC and a study area in the Sierra Nevada, California. For individual tree detection, the algorithm correctly identified 70{\%} of dominant trees, 58{\%} of codominant trees, 35{\%} of intermediate trees and 21{\%} of suppressed trees at SERC. The algorithm had difficulty distinguishing between crowns of small, dense understory trees of approximately the same height. Delineated crown volume alone explained 53{\%} and 84{\%} of the variability in basal area at the SERC and Sierra Nevada sites, respectively. The algorithm produced crown area distributions comparable to diameter at breast height (DBH) size class distributions observed in the field in both study sites. The algorithm detected understory crowns better in the conifer-dominated Sierra Nevada site than in the closed-canopy deciduous site in Maryland. The ability for the algorithm to reproduce both accurate tree size distributions and individual crown geometries in two dissimilar and complex forests suggests great promise for applicability to a wide range of forest systems.},

Height thresholds and percentage cover of vegetation from the CHM were used to produce larger quantities of reliable training data compared to other, mostly point or plot-based, ground-truthing approaches. It was found that the regional-scale differentiation between woody and nonwoody vegetation might be achieved by a combination of L-band dual-polarized Phased Array type L-band synthetic aperture radar data (HV) with multispectral optical data that include a short-wave infrared band. The application of a support vector machine algorithm to these data proved successful. The versatility of these algorithms regarding the discrimination function and their ability to solve classification problems with multiple output classes were critical factors for success.

abstract = {Mast seeding is the intermittent production of large quantities of seed across a perennial plant population. Such seeding events in many plant species are initiated by climatic cues, but whether these cues act solely as triggers or also via alterations to nutrient availability is unclear. Here, we examine the effect of nitrogenous fertilization on the relationship between seed production in Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides and two climatic cues (rainfall and temperature) at specific stages in reproductive development from 1999 to 2008. Foliar nitrogen concentrations were positively correlated with rainfall among years, suggesting rainfall was affecting nitrogen availability. Seedfall mass in unfertilized stands was predominantly determined by rainfall during resource priming, while seed production in fertilized stands was more affected by temperature during floral primordia development. Similarly, seedfall mass in older stands, which contain greater internal nutrient reserves, was predominantly determined by temperature. Synthesis. The results of this study demonstrate that the sensitivity of seed production to climatic cues can be altered by manipulation of resource availability and therefore establish that climatic cues involved in the synchronization of mast seeding can influence reproductive effort via an effect on resource availability. These results also indicate that alterations to resource availability have the potential to alter inter-annual patterns of seed production, but further study is required to verify this finding. {\textcopyright} 2011 Scion and Landcare Research.

abstract = {There are a large number of image formats already in use within the remote sensing community but currently there is no format that provides the features of: compression, support for large file sizes, ground control points, raster attribute tables and inbuilt image pyramids. Therefore, a new image format, named KEA, after the New Zealand bird, has been proposed. The KEA format provides a full implementation of the GDAL data model and is implemented within a HDF5 file. A software library with a GDAL driver have been freely provided to the community allowing use through any GDAL based software. The new format has comparable performance with existing formats while producing smaller file sizes and is already within active use for a number of projects within Landcare Research, New Zealand, and the wider community. Highlights: A new file format which fully supports the GDAL data model. Specific support for very large file, with small file sizes due to compression throughout. Provision of a GDAL driver such that the new format can be seamless used within existing software. Support for raster attribute tables, allowing raster GIS operations. Built on HDF5 providing security of data archiving and broad support. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {A detailed view of Southern Hemisphere storm tracks is obtained based on the application of filtered variance and modern feature-tracking techniques to a wide range of 45-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data. It has been checked that the conclusions drawn in this study are valid even if data from only the satellite era are used. The emphasis of the paper is on the winter season, but results for the four seasons are also discussed. Both upper- and lower-tropospheric fields are used. The tracking analysis focuses on systems that last longer than 2 days and are mobile (move more than 1000 km). Many of the results support previous ideas about the storm tracks, but some new insights are also obtained. In the summer there is a rather circular, strong, deep high-latitude storm track. In winter the high-latitude storm track is more asymmetric with a spiral from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans in toward Antarctica and a subtropical jet-related lower-latitude storm track over the Pacific, again tending to spiral poleward. At all times of the year, maximum storm activity in the higher-latitude storm track is in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean regions. In the winter upper troposphere, the relative importance of, and interplay between, the subtropical and subpolar storm tracks is discussed. The genesis, lysis, and growth rate of lower-tropospheric winter cyclones together lead to a vivid picture of their behavior that is summarized as a set of overlapping plates, each composed of cyclone life cycles. Systems in each plate appear to feed the genesis in the next plate through downstream development in the upper-troposphere spiral storm track. In the lee of the Andes in South America, there is cyclogenesis associated with the subtropical jet and also, poleward of this, cyclogenesis largely associated with system decay on the upslope and regeneration on the downslope. The genesis and lysis of cyclones and anticyclones have a definite spatial relationship with each other and with the Andes. At 500 hPa, their relative longitudinal positions are consistent with vortex-stretching ideas for simple flow over a large-scale mountain. Cyclonic systems near Antarctica have generally spiraled in from lower latitudes. However, cyclogenesis associated with mobile cyclones occurs around the Antarctic coast with an interesting genesis maximum over the sea ice near 150°E. The South Pacific storm track emerges clearly from the tracking as a coherent deep feature spiraling from Australia to southern South America. A feature of the summer season is the genesis of eastward-moving cyclonic systems near the tropic of Capricorn off Brazil, in the central Pacific and, to a lesser extent, off Madagascar, followed by movement along the southwest flanks of the subtropical anticyclones and contribution to the "convergence zone" cloud bands seen in these regions. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {In both ecology and forestry, there is a high demand for structural information of forest stands. Forest structures, due to their heterogeneity and density, are often difficult to assess. Hence, a variety of technologies are being applied to account for this "difficult to come by" information. Common techniques are aerial images or ground- and airborne-Lidar. In the present study we evaluate the potential use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a platform for tree stem detection in open stands. A flight campaign over a test site near Freiburg, Germany covering a target area of 120 × 75 [m2] was conducted. The dominant tree species of the site is oak (quercus robur) with almost no understory growth. Over 1000 images with a tilt angle of 45° were shot. The flight pattern applied consisted of two antipodal staggered flight routes at a height of 55 [m] above the ground. We used a Panasonic G3 consumer camera equipped with a 14-42 [mm] standard lens and a 16.6 megapixel sensor. The data collection took place in leaf-off state in April 2013. The area was prepared with artificial ground control points for transformation of the structure-from-motion (SFM) point cloud into real world coordinates. After processing, the results were compared with a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) point cloud of the same area. In the 0.9 [ha] test area, 102 individual trees above 7 [cm] diameter at breast height were located on in the TLS-cloud. We chose the software CMVS/PMVS-2 since its algorithms are developed with focus on dense reconstruction. The processing chain for the UAV-acquired images consists of six steps: a. cleaning the data: removing of blurry, under- or over exposed and off-site images; b. applying the SIFT operator [Lowe, 2004]; c. image matching; d. bundle adjustment; e. clustering; and f. dense reconstruction. In total, 73 stems were considered as reconstructed and located within one meter of the reference trees. In general stems were far less accurate and complete as in the TLS-point cloud. Only few stems were considered to be fully reconstructed. From the comparison of reconstruction achievement with respect to height above ground, we can state that reconstruction accuracy decreased in the crown layer of the stand. In addition we were cutting 50 [cm] slices in z-direction and applied a robust cylinder fit to the stem slices. Radii of the TLS-cloud and the SFM-cloud surprisingly correlated well with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of r = 0.696. This first study showed promising results for UAV-based forest structure modelling. Yet, there is a demand for additional research with regard to vegetation stages, flight pattern, processing setup and the utilisation of spectral information.},

abstract = {Agricultural systems with grazing animals are increasingly under scrutiny for their contribution to quality degradation of waterways and water bodies. Soil type, climate, animal type and nitrogen (N) fertilisation are contributors to the variation in N that is leached through the soil profile into ground and surface water. It is difficult to explore the effect of these factors using experimentation only and modelling is proposed as an alternative. An agro-ecosystem model, EcoMod, was used to quantify the pastoral ecosystem responses to situational variability in climate and soil, choice of animal type and N fertilisation level within the Lake Taupo region of New Zealand. Factorial combinations of soil type (Oruanui and Waipahihi), climate (low, moderate and high rainfall), animal type (sheep, beef and dairy) and N fertilisation level (0 or 60 kg. N/ha/yr) were simulated. High rainfall climates also had colder temperatures, grew less pasture and carried fewer animals overall which lead to less dung and urinary N returned. Therefore, even though a higher proportion of N returned ultimately leached at the higher rainfall sites, the total N leached did not differ greatly between sites. Weather variation between years had a marked influence on N leaching within a site, due to the timing and magnitude of rainfall events. In this region, for these two highly permeable soil types, N applied as fertiliser had a high propensity to leach, either after being taken up by plants, grazed and returned to the soil as dung and urine, or due to direct flow through the soil profile. Soil type had a considerable effect on N leaching risk, the timing of N leaching and mean pasture production. Nitrogen leaching was greatest from beef cattle, followed by dairy and sheep with the level of leaching related to urine deposition patterns for each animal type and due to the amount of N returned to the soil as excreta. Simulation results indicate that sheep farming systems with limited fertiliser N inputs will reduce N leaching from farms in the Lake Taupo catchment. ? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of forest stands, constructed from scans of the Echidna?? full-waveform terrestrial lidar, provide a new pathway to estimate forest structural parameters such as tree diameter at breast height, tree height, crown diameter, and stem count density (trees per hectare). We provide such reconstructions using data from the Echidna?? Validation Instrument (EVI), which emits laser pulses at 1064nm wavelength and digitizes the full return waveform. We reconstructed four stands from the Sierra National Forest and two stands from Harvard Experimental Forest of 50m by 50m size, with varying tree density and species, using data acquired in 2008 and 2009. Our procedure processes each lidar pulse return to identify one or multiple "hits" and their associated peak return power; converts peak power to apparent reflectance; locates hits in Cartesian coordinate space and stores them as points in a point cloud with associated attributes; registers and merges five (Sierra) or nine (Harvard) overlapping scans into a single point cloud; identifies the ground plane and classifies ground hits; produces a local digital elevation model; classifies non-ground hits as trunk/branch or foliage hits using the relative width of the return pulse; and uses commercial software tools to display, manipulate, and interact with the point cloud to make direct measurements of trees in the virtual space of the reconstruction. Results show good to very good agreement between virtual and manual measurements of tree diameter, height, and crown size, with R2 values ranging from 0.70 to 0.99. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This study evaluates the temporal variability of the Antarctic surface mass balance, approximated as precipitation minus evaporation (P - E), and Southern Ocean precipitation in five global reanalyses during 1989-2009. The datasets consist of the NCEP/U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project 2 reanalysis (NCEP-2), the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) 25-year Reanalysis (JRA-25), ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim), NASA Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Application (MERRA), and the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR). Reanalyses are known to be prone to spurious trends and inhomogeneities caused by changes in the observing system, especially in the data-sparse high southern latitudes. The period of study has seen a dramatic increase in the amount of satellite observations used for data assimilation. The large positive and statistically significant trends in mean Antarctic P - E and mean Southern Ocean precipitation in NCEP-2, JRA-25, and MERRA are found to be largely spurious. The origin of these artifacts varies between reanalyses. Notably, a precipitation jump in MERRA in the late 1990s coincides with the start of the assimilation of radiances from the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU). ERA-Interim and CFSR do not exhibit any significant trends. However, the potential impact of the assimilation of rain-affected radiances in ERA-Interim and inhomogeneities in CFSR pressure fields over Antarctica cast some doubt on the reliability of these two datasets. The authors conclude that ERA-Interim likely offers the most realistic depiction of precipitation changes in high southern latitudes during 1989-2009. The range of the trends in Antarctic P - E among the reanalyses is equivalent to 1 mm of sea level over 21 years, which highlights the improvements still needed in reanalysis simulations to better assess the contribution of Antarctica to sea level rise. Finally, this work argues for continuing cautious use of reanalysis datasets for climate change assessment.},

abstract = {Pastoral systems are increasingly under scrutiny for the nitrogen (N) deposited via urine, faeces and fertiliser that is subsequently transported through the soil profile into water ways. Variation in land management, fertiliser N application rates, soil type, climate and year-to-year variation in weather all affect the rate and timing of N losses via leaching. To mitigate N leaching, a better understanding of the environmental conditions and the identification of early indicators that lead to high risk of N leaching are needed. To identify early indicators for risk of N leaching from urine patches we used the APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems SIMulator) model to produce an extensive N leaching dataset for the Waikato region of New Zealand. In total 198000 simulation runs with different combinations of urine deposition date, N loading, soil type and irrigation were done. The risk forecasting indicators were chosen based on their practicality: being easy to be measured on farm (soil water content, temperature and pasture growth) or that could be centrally measured (such as weather forecasting). The thresholds of the early indicators that are likely to forecast a period for high risk of N leaching were determined via classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. This concept is illustrated in Figure 1 for a soil with a medium soil depth, with soil plant available water of 125-150 mm. The identified early indicators were then used within a N risk tool, based on a traffic light system, to trigger duration controlled grazing in a desktop evaluation to reduce N leaching on a paddock scale. Predicted reductions in N leaching ranged from 20 to 45{\%}, depending on the number of indicators used and the risk alertness of the farmer.},

abstract = {Ruminants excrete as much as 70–95{\%} of the nitrogen (N) they consume. The urine patch is the conduit through which much of this N is recycled in grazed pasture systems. This chapter focuses on three key areas: urine patch characteristics and N cycling processes; implications for N cycling at the farm and paddock scale; and strategies available to mitigate N losses from the urine patch. The urine patch N loading rate is a key metric for quantifying and modeling fate of N; yet it is a derived value, relying on estimates of urine volume and N concentration, and the urine patch surface area, all of which are variable. Much is known about N cycling processes in the urine patch but further understanding of N loss, leaching of dissolved organic N, and mineralization–immobilization turnover is needed. Typical values (as a percentage of the deposited urinary N) were estimated as: 13{\%} ammonia volatilization; 2{\%} nitrous oxide emission; 20{\%} nitrate leaching; 41{\%} pasture uptake; 26{\%} gross immobilization. The relative importance of each process is influenced by urine patch characteristics and environmental factors. Models are an important tool for scaling from the individual urine patch to the paddock and farm scale, though accounting for variability in urine patch characteristics, and spatial and temporal distribution, remains a challenge. Many potential management strategies to decrease N loss from the urine patch are still at the proof of concept stage with few actually deployed on the farm. Further research is required to integrate these into farm management systems.},

abstract = {An intercomparison of high-latitude precipitation characteristics from observation-based and reanalysis products is performed. In particular, the precipitation products from CloudSat provide an independent assessment to other widely used products, these being the observationally based Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), Global Precipitation Climatology Centre, and Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) products and the ERA-Interim, Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), and National Centers for Environmental Prediction-Department of Energy Reanalysis 2 (NCEP-DOE R2) reanalyses. Seasonal and annual total precipitation in both hemispheres poleward of 55° latitude are considered in all products, and CloudSat is used to assess intensity and frequency of precipitation occurrence by phase, defined as rain, snow, or mixed phase. Furthermore, an independent estimate of snow accumulation during the cold season was calculated from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment. The intercomparison is performed for the 2007–2010 period when CloudSat was fully operational. It is found that ERA-Interim and MERRA are broadly similar, agreeing more closely with CloudSat over oceans. ERA-Interim also agrees well with CloudSat estimates of snowfall over Antarctica where total snowfall from GPCP and CloudSat is almost identical. A number of disagreements on regional or seasonal scales are identified: CMAP reports much lower ocean precipitation relative to other products, NCEP-DOE R2 reports much higher summer precipitation over Northern Hemisphere land, GPCP reports much higher snowfall over Eurasia, and CloudSat overestimates precipitation over Greenland, likely due to mischaracterization of rain and mixed-phase precipitation. These outliers are likely unrealistic for these specific regions and time periods. These estimates from observations and reanalyses provide useful insights for diagnostic assessment of precipitation products in high latitudes, quantifying the current uncertainties, improving the products, and establishing a benchmark for assessment of climate models.},

abstract = {This paper reviews our understanding of how the effects of the El Ni{\~{n}}o-southern oscillation (ENSO) might be transmitted from the tropical Pacific Ocean to the Antarctic, and examines the evidence for such signals in the Antarctic meteorological, sea ice, ice core and biological records. Many scientific disciples concerned with the Antarctic require an understanding of how the climatic conditions in the tropical and mid-latitude regions affect the Antarctic, and it is hoped that this review will aid their work.The most pronounced signals of ENSO are found over the southeast Pacific as a result of a climatological Rossby wave train that gives positive (negative) height anomalies over the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea during El Ni{\~{n}}o (La Ni{\~{n}}a) events. However, the extra-tropical signature can sometimes show a high degree of variability between events in this area. In West Antarctica, links between ENSO and precipitation have shown variability on the decadal time scale. Across the continent itself, it is even more difficult to relate meteorological conditions to ENSO, yet analyses of the long meteorological records from the stations do indicate a distinct switch in sign of the pressure anomalies from positive to negative across the minimum in the southern oscillation index.The oceanic signals of ENSO around the Antarctic are less clear, but it has been suggested that the Antarctic circumpolar wave could be forced by the phenomenon.Ice-core data offer the potential to help in understanding the long-term relationship between ENSO and the climate of the Antarctic, but there are difficulties because of the need to smooth the ice-core data to overcome the mixing of snow on the surface. Nevertheless, analysis of methylsulphonic acid in a South Pole core has shown high variability on ENSO time scales. It is clear that some evidence of ENSO can be found in the Antarctic meteorological and ice-core records; however, many of the relationships tend not to be stable with time, and we currently have a poor understanding of the transfer functions by which such signals arrive at the Antarctic from the tropical Pacific.},

abstract = {Accurate three-dimensional representations of cultural heritage sites are highly valuable for scientific study, conservation, and educational purposes. In addition to their use for archival purposes, 3D models enable efficient and precise measurement of relevant natural and architectural features. Many cultural heritage sites are large and complex, consisting of multiple structures spatially distributed over tens of thousands of square metres. The process of effectively digitising such geometrically complex locations requires measurements to be acquired from a variety of viewpoints. While several technologies exist for capturing the 3D structure of objects and environments, none are ideally suited to complex, large-scale sites, mainly due to their limited coverage or acquisition efficiency. We explore the use of a recently developed handheld mobile mapping system called Zebedee in cultural heritage applications. The Zebedee system is capable of efficiently mapping an environment in three dimensions by continually acquiring data as an operator holding the device traverses through the site. The system was deployed at the former Peel Island Lazaret, a culturally significant site in Queensland, Australia, consisting of dozens of buildings of various sizes spread across an area of approximately 400 ?? 250 m. With the Zebedee system, the site was scanned in half a day, and a detailed 3D point cloud model (with over 520 million points) was generated from the 3.6 hours of acquired data in 2.6 hours. We present results demonstrating that Zebedee was able to accurately capture both site context and building detail comparable in accuracy to manual measurement techniques, and at a greatly increased level of efficiency and scope. The scan allowed us to record derelict buildings that previously could not be measured because of the scale and complexity of the site. The resulting 3D model captures both interior and exterior features of buildings, including structure, materials, and the contents of rooms. ?? 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {Pastoral systems are increasingly under scrutiny for the nitrogen (N) deposited via urine, faeces and fertiliser that is subsequently transported through the soil profile into water ways. Variation in land management, fertiliser N application rates, soil type, climate and year-to-year variation in weather all affect the rate and timing of N losses via leaching. To mitigate N leaching, a better understanding of the environmental conditions and the identification of early indicators that lead to high risk of N leaching are needed. To identify early indicators for risk of N leaching from urine patches we used the APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems SIMulator) model to produce an extensive N leaching dataset for the Waikato region of New Zealand. In total 198000 simulation runs with different combinations of urine deposition date, N loading, soil type and irrigation were done. The risk forecasting indicators were chosen based on their practicality: being easy to be measured on farm (soil water content, temperature and pasture growth) or that could be centrally measured (such as weather forecasting). The thresholds of the early indicators that are likely to forecast a period for high risk of N leaching were determined via classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. This concept is illustrated in Figure 1 for a soil with a medium soil depth, with soil plant available water of 125-150 mm. The identified early indicators were then used within a N risk tool, based on a traffic light system, to trigger duration controlled grazing in a desktop evaluation to reduce N leaching on a paddock scale. Predicted reductions in N leaching ranged from 20 to 45{\%}, depending on the number of indicators used and the risk alertness of the farmer.},

The program of validation was divided into three steps aiming at its three premise questions, respectively: 1) Can MLS record echoes with precise coordinates in the scenario of forest overstory shading satellite wireless positioning signals? 2) Can MLS samplings subject to spatial distribution inconsistency show the basic structures of understory trees? and 3) Can MLS data, further, present the local details of understory tree structures? The examinations were carried out based on the related typical feature variables, i.e., 1) overstory tree stem positioning accuracy as a substitute and 2) understory tree height and crown width and the newly proposed measure of object detail characterization, i.e., 3) primary nearest point distance (PNPD). The results proved to be positive. Overall, although the discussions suggested that MLS has its shortages, e.g., its cover still restricted by tree obscuration, this endeavor has primarily validated MLS for understory tree characterization in urban forest. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Decision making on forest resources relies on the precise information that is collected using inventory. There are many different kinds of forest inventory techniques that can be applied depending on the goal, scale, resources and the required accuracy. Most of the forest inventories are based on field sample. Therefore, the accuracy of the forest inventories depends on the quality and quantity of the field sample. Conventionally, field sample has been measured using simple tools. When map is required, remote sensing materials are needed. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) provides a measurement technique that can acquire millimeter-level of detail from the surrounding area, which allows rapid, automatic and periodical estimates of many important forest inventory attributes. It is expected that TLS will be operationally used in forest inventories as soon as the appropriate software becomes available, best practices become known and general knowledge of these findings becomes more wide spread. Meanwhile, mobile laser scanning, personal laser scanning, and image-based point clouds became capable of capturing similar terrestrial point cloud data as TLS. This paper reviews the advances of applying TLS in forest inventories, discusses its properties with reference to other related techniques and discusses the future prospects of this technique.},

abstract = {A continental scale evaluation of Antarctic surface winds is presented from global ERA-40 and ERA-Interim reanalyses and RACMO2/ANT regional climate model at 55 and 27 km horizontal resolution, based on a comparison with observational data from 115 automatic weather stations (AWS). The Antarctic surface wind cli-mate can be classified based on the Weibull shape factor k w . Very high values (k w [ 3) are found in the interior plateaus, typical of very uniform katabatic-dominated winds with high directional constancy. In the coast and all over the Antarctic Peninsula the shape factors are similar to the ones found in mid-latitudes (k w $\backslash$ 3) typical of syn-optically dominated wind climates. The Weibull shape parameter is systematically overpredicted by ERA reanal-yses. This is partly corrected by RACMO2/ANT simula-tions which introduce more wind speed variability in complex terrain areas. A significant improvement is observed in the performance of ERA-Interim over ERA-40, with an overall decrease of 14 {\%} in normalized mean absolute error. In escarpment and coastal areas, where the terrain gets rugged and katabatic winds are further inten-sified in confluence zones, ERA-Interim bias can be as high as 10 m s -1 . These large deviations are partly corrected by the regional climate model. Given that RACMO2/ANT is an independent simulation of the near-surface wind speed climate, as it is not driven by observations, it compares very well to the ERA-Interim and AWS-115 datasets.},

Here, we show for 26 long-term data sets from five plant families that the temperature difference between the two previous summers ($\Delta$T) better predicts seed crops. This discovery explains how masting species tailor their flowering patterns to sites across altitudinal temperature gradients; predicts that masting will be unaffected by increasing mean temperatures under climate change; improves prediction of impacts on seed consumers; demonstrates that strongly masting species are hypersensitive to climate; explains the rarity of consecutive high-seed years without invoking resource constraints; and generates hypotheses about physiological mechanisms in plants and insect seed predators. For plants, $\Delta$T has many attributes of an ideal cue. This temperature-difference model clarifies our understanding of mast seeding under environmental change, and could also be applied to other cues, such as rainfall. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {This paper highlights a novel segmentation approach for single trees from LIDAR data and compares the results acquired both from first/last pulse and full waveform data. In a first step, a conventional watershed-based segmentation procedure is set up, which robustly interpolates the canopy height model from the LIDAR data and identifies possible stem positions of the tallest trees in the segments calculated from the local maxima of the canopy height model. Secondly, this segmentation approach is combined with a special stem detection method. Stem positions in the segments of the watershed segmentation are detected by hierarchically clustering points below the crown base height and reconstructing the stems with a robust RANSAC-based estimation of the stem points. Finally, a new three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of single trees is implemented using normalized cut segmentation. This tackles the problem of segmenting small trees below the canopy height model. The key idea is to subdivide the tree area in a voxel space and to set up a bipartite graph which is formed by the voxels and similarity measures between the voxels. Normalized cut segmentation divides the graph hierarchically into segments which have a minimum similarity with each other and whose members (= voxels) have a maximum similarity. The solution is found by solving a corresponding generalized eigenvalue problem and an appropriate binarization of the solution vector. Experiments were conducted in the Bavarian Forest National Park with conventional first/last pulse data and full waveform LIDAR data. The first/last pulse data were collected in a flight with the Falcon II system from TopoSys in a leaf-on situation at a point density of 10 points/m2. Full waveform data were captured with the Riegl LMS-Q560 scanner at a point density of 25 points/m2 (leaf-off and leaf-on) and at a point density of 10 points/m2 (leaf-on). The study results prove that the new 3D segmentation approach is capable of detecting small trees in the lower forest layer. So far, this has been practically impossible if tree segmentation techniques based on the canopy height model were applied to LIDAR data. Compared to a standard watershed segmentation procedure, the combination of the stem detection method and normalized cut segmentation leads to the best segmentation results and is superior in the best case by 12{\%}. Moreover, the experiments show clearly that using full waveform data is superior to using first/last pulse data. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {Feed nitrogen (N) intakes in Australian grazing systems average 545 g cow−1 day−1, indicating that urinary N is likely to be the dominant form excreted. Grazing animals spend disproportionate amounts of time in places on dairy farms where N accumulation is likely to occur. We attached to grazing cows sensors that measure urine volume and N concentration, as well as global positioning systems sensors used to monitor the times the cows spent in different places on a farm and the location of urination events. The cows were monitored for up to 72 h in each of two seasons. More urination events and greater urine volumes per event were recorded in spring 2014 (3.1 L) compared with winter 2015 (1.4 L), most likely influenced by environmental conditions and the greater spring rainfall observed. Mean (range) N concentration (0.71{\%}; 0.02 to 1.52{\%}) and N load (12.8 g cow−1 event−1; 0.3 to 64.5 g cow−1 event−1) did not differ over the two monitoring periods. However, mean (range) daily N load was greater in spring (277 g cow−1 day−1; 200 to 346 g cow−1 day−1) than in winter (90 g cow−1 day−1; 44 to 116 g cow−1 day−1) due to the influence of urine volume. Relatively greater time was spent in paddocks overnight (13.3 h) than in paddocks between morning and evening milking (6.4 h), compared with the mean numbers of urinations in these places (6.4 and 3.8 respectively). The mean N load deposited overnight in paddocks (89.6 g cow−1) was more than twice that deposited in paddocks during the day (43.8 g cow−1), due to the greater N load per event overnight, and was more closely linked to the relative difference in time spent in paddocks than in the number of urination events. These data suggest that routinely holding cows in the same paddocks overnight will lead to high urinary N depositions, increasing the potential for N losses from these places. Further research using this technology is required to acquire farm and environment specific urinary data to improve N management.},

The profitability of exploiting this resource is conditioned by the amount of existing biomass within urban community ecosystems. Prior research pointed out that residual biomass from Platanus hispanica and other tree species can be calculated from dendrometric parameters. In this study, two approaches have been analyzed: First, applicability of TLS was tested for residual biomass calculation from crown volume. In addition, traditional models for residual biomass prediction were developed from dendrometric parameters (tree height, crown diameter, and diameter at breast height). Next, a comparison between parameters obtained with both methodologies (standard methodologies vs TLS) was carried out. The results indicate a strong relationship (R2=0.906) between crown diameters and between total tree heights (R2=0.868). The crown volumes extracted from the TLS point cloud were calculated by 4 different methods: convex hull; convex hull by slices of 5cm height in the XY plane; triangulation by XY flat sections, and voxel modeling. The highest accuracy was found when the voxel method was used for pruned biomass prediction (R2=0.731). The results revealed the potential of TLS data to determine dendrometric parameters and biomass yielded from pruning quitar of urban forests. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Herewe reconstruct annual mean changes in the SAM since AD 1000 using, for the first time, proxy records that encompass the full mid-latitude to polar domain across the Drake Passage sector.We find that the SAM has undergone a progressive shift towards its positive phase since the fifteenth century, causing cooling of the main Antarctic continent at the same time that the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed. The positive trend in the SAM since ∼AD 1940 is reproduced by multimodel climate simulations forced with rising greenhouse gas levels and later ozone depletion, and the long-termaverage SAMindex is nowat its highest level for at least the past 1,000 years.Reconstructed SAMtrends before the twentieth century are more prominent than those in radiative-forcing climate experiments and may be associated with a teleconnected response to tropical Pacific climate.

abstract = {Assessments of forest canopy structure remain a challenge and are most often conducted using indirect techniques limited to a two-dimensional perspective. Using terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) technology, a three-dimensional (3D) approach to study canopy structure was conducted by modeling forest scenes from three broadleaved forest stands with different canopy features. Field TLS data were collected from each stand using a phase based FARO?? LS880 laser scanner on four sampling setups. The capability of TLS-derived data to represent canopy structure was evaluated by comparing gap fraction estimates from the 3D models with gap fraction values from digital hemispherical photographs (DHP). Firstly, the collected 3D point clouds were processed to obtain fully representative voxel-based models of the forest canopy. Secondly, ray tracing algorithms were applied on these models to simulate hemispherical views and estimate gap fraction. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was done using different voxel sizes and the four sampling setups on the simulations, in order to assess their impact on the gap fraction estimates derived from TLS data. Results of TLS-derived gap fraction showed that combining nine scans produced better results in all forest stand. Similarly, the dimension of voxels have a marked influence on these results. Voxel sizes of 1cm, 2cm and 4cm were found to have less error when compared with real gap fraction values derived from DHP for young, intermediate and mature forest stands, respectively (RMSE ranging from 9{\%} to 16{\%}). However, substantial differences in gap fraction were observed and described at different zenith angles. These results suggest that specific TLS sampling setup and processing are required depending upon the forest type under analysis. Overall, this research indicates that phase based TLS data can be used for objective calculation of gap fraction. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Understanding the causes of variation in func-tional plant traits is a central issue in ecology, particularly in the context of global change. Spectroscopy is increasingly used for rapid and non-destructive estimation of foliar traits, but few studies have evaluated its accuracy when assess-ing phenotypic variation in multiple traits. Working with 24 chemical and physical leaf traits of six European tree species growing on strongly contrasting soil types (i.e. deep alluvium versus nearby shallow chalk), we asked (i) whether variabil-ity in leaf traits is greater between tree species or soil type, and (ii) whether field spectroscopy is effective at predicting intraspecific variation in leaf traits as well as interspecific dif-ferences. Analysis of variance showed that interspecific dif-ferences in traits were generally much stronger than intraspe-cific differences related to soil type, accounting for 25 {\%} ver-sus 5 {\%} of total trait variation, respectively. Structural traits, phenolic defences and pigments were barely affected by soil type. In contrast, foliar concentrations of rock-derived nutri-ents did vary: P and K concentrations were lower on chalk than alluvial soils, while Ca, Mg, B, Mn and Zn concentra-tions were all higher, consistent with the findings of previous ecological studies. Foliar traits were predicted from 400 to 2500 nm reflectance spectra collected by field spectroscopy using partial least square regression, a method that is com-monly employed in chemometrics. Pigments were best mod-elled using reflectance data from the visible region (400– 700 nm), while all other traits were best modelled using re-flectance data from the shortwave infrared region (1100– 2500 nm). Spectroscopy delivered accurate predictions of species-level variation in traits. However, it was ineffective at detecting intraspecific variation in rock-derived nutrients (with the notable exception of P). The explanation for this failure is that rock-derived elements do not have absorption features in the 400–2500 nm region, and their estimation is indirect, relying on elemental concentrations covarying with structural traits that do have absorption features in that spec-tral region (" constellation effects "). Since the structural traits did not vary with soil type, it was impossible for our regres-sion models to predict intraspecific variation in rock-derived nutrients via constellation effects. This study demonstrates the value of spectroscopy for rapid, non-destructive estima-tion of foliar traits across species, but highlights problems with predicting intraspecific variation indirectly. We discuss the implications of these findings for mapping functional traits by airborne imaging spectroscopy.},

The spatial interpolation relies on a kriging technique aided by spatiotemporal temperature covariances derived from three global reanalyses [the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim), Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR)].

The N that is not used by plants is likely to be lost through leaching, emitted as N gases or added to the soil organic N pool. The present study used custom-made global positioning system (GPS) and urine sensors on 20 non-lactating ewes and 20 non-lactating beef heifers grazing steep hill country to determine potential critical source areas for N loss to the environment. Bite counters on four sheep and five heifers showed when and where animals were eating. Animals were monitored simultaneously on 0.5 ha adjacent paddocks over 8 days. Sheep and cows urinated a mean (±s.d.) of 21.2 ± 6.1 and 9.0 ± 3.0 times/day, respectively. Eating started soon after sunrise and increased during the day to reach a maximum in the hour before sunset, after which the eating activity of both species was near zero for most of the night, except for a short feeding period at around 0300 hours. The urination frequency of sheep increased as eating activity increased during the day, but this relationship was not seen in heifers. Land classified as easy hill country (≤12°) comprised 31{\%} of the sheep paddock and contained 23{\%} of the urination events. In contrast, although the easy hill country comprised 33{\%} of the cattle paddock, 46{\%} of the urine patches were in this area. Although aerial application of N mitigation products to whole paddocks or farms is uneconomic, the results of the present study suggest that mitigation products could possibly be cost-effectively targeted to easy contoured, cattle-grazed hill country areas accessible by farm vehicle. },

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) leaching losses from grazing systems originate primarily from animal urine patches. The N load in urine patches has strong effects on N leaching and varies largely with variations in volume and N concentration of urination events. The effects of these variations in volume and N concentration of urination events on N leaching have not yet been explored. We present a framework for assessing N leaching losses from grazed pastures that incorporates variations of urination events. We found that, for the same amount of urinary N deposition, annual N leaching losses at paddock level increased logarithmically with increased mean urine volume or N concentration, though N leaching at urine patch level increased exponentially with N deposition rate. The estimates of N leaching losses using mean urine patches, derived from mean urine volume and N concentration, would be less than that estimated using variable urine patches as deposited by animals. Results for a case-study pasture on free-draining pumice soils indicate that, for the same number of urination events, depositing the same amount of urinary N within a year, N leaching would be underestimated by 5-8{\%}, when using average urine patches as opposed to varying both volume and N concentration; and the underestimation would be bigger for pastures on soils of greater water holding capacity. Our results indicate the necessity of more accurate estimation of mean and variation patterns of urine volume and N concentration of urination events for improving estimates of N leaching risks. The results support the development of N leaching mitigation strategies by feeding animal diuretics, and are useful to recommend animal species and age class for areas of high N leaching risks. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Determination of stem and crown biomass requires accurate measurements of individual tree stem, bark, branch and needles. These measurements are time-consuming especially for mature trees. Accurate field measurements can be done only in a destructive manner. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) measurements are a viable option for measuring the reference information needed. TLS measurements provide dense point clouds in which features describing biomass can be extracted for stem form and canopy dimensions. Existing biomass models do not utilise canopy size information and therefore TLS-based estimation methods should improve the accuracy of biomass estimation. The main objective of this study was to estimate single-tree-level aboveground biomass (AGB), based on models developed using TLS data. The modelling dataset included 64 laboratory-measured trees. Models were developed for total AGB, tree stem-, living branch- and dead branch biomass. Modelling results were also compared with existing individual tree-level biomass models and showed that AGB estimation accuracies were improved, compared with those of existing models. However, current biomass models based on diameter-at-breast height (DBH), tree height and species worked rather well for stem- and total biomass. TLS-based models improved estimation accuracies, especially estimation of branch biomass. We suggest the use of stem curve and crown size geometric measurements from TLS data as a basis for allometric biomass models rather than statistical three-dimensional point metrics, since TLS statistical metrics are dependent on various scanning parameters and tree neighbourhood characteristics. ?? 2012 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Using a network of 804 field inventory plots distributed across a wide range of tropical vegetation types, climates and successional states, we present a general conceptual and technical approach for linking tropical forest EACDfield to LiDAR top-of-canopy height (TCH) using regional-scale inputs of basal area and wood density. With this approach, we show that EACDLiDAR and EACDfield reach nearly 90{\%} agreement at 1-ha resolution for a wide array of tropical vegetation types. We also show that Lorey's Height - a common metric used to calibrate LiDAR measurements to biomass - is severely flawed in open canopy forests that are common to the tropics.

Traditional map-updating procedures, such as visual interpretation of digital aerial images or field measurements using tachymeters, are either inaccurate or expensive. Recently, the development of laser-scanning technology has opened new opportunities for tree mapping and attributes updating. For a detailed measurement and attributes update of urban trees, we tested the use of a multisource single-tree inventory (MS-STI) for heterogeneous urban forest conditions. MS-STI requires an existing tree map as input information in addition to airborne laser-scanning (ALS) data. In our study, the tested input tree map was produced by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and by using a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Tree attributes were either measured from ALS or predicted by using metrics extracted from ALS data. Stem diameter-at-breast height (DBH) was predicted and compared to the field measures, and tree height and crown area were directly measured from ALS data at the two different urban-forest areas. The results indicate that MS-STI can be used for updating urban-forest attributes. The accuracies of DBH estimations were improved compared to the existing attribute information in the city of Helsinki's urban-tree register.

Single trees are extracted from the TLS data and quantitative structure models are used to estimate the tree volume directly from the point cloud data. AGB is inferred from these volumes and basic density information and is then compared with the estimates derived from allometric equations and destructive sampling. * AGB estimates derived from TLS show a high agreement with the reference values from destructive sampling, with a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0{\textperiodcentered}98. The agreement between AGB estimates from allometric equations and the reference is lower (CCC = 0{\textperiodcentered}68–0{\textperiodcentered}78). Our TLS approach shows a total AGB overestimation of 9{\textperiodcentered}68{\%} compared to an underestimation of 36{\textperiodcentered}57–29{\textperiodcentered}85{\%} for the allometric equations. * The error for AGB estimates using allometric equations increases exponentially with increasing DBH, whereas the error for AGB estimates from TLS is not dependent on DBH. The TLS method does not rely on indirect relationships with tree parameters or calibration data and shows better agreement with the reference data compared to estimates from allometric equations. Using 3D data also enables us to look at the height distributions of AGB, and we demonstrate that 80{\%} of the AGB at plot level is located in the lower 60{\%} of the trees for a Eucalypt Open Forest. This method can be applied in many forest types and can assist in the calibration and validation of broad-scale biomass maps.},

abstract = {Agricultural systems with grazing animals are increasingly under scrutiny for their contribution to quality degradation of waterways and water bodies. Soil type, climate, animal type and nitrogen (N) fertilisation are contributors to the variation in N that is leached through the soil profile into ground and surface water. It is difficult to explore the effect of these factors using experimentation only and modelling is proposed as an alternative. An agro-ecosystem model, EcoMod, was used to quantify the pastoral ecosystem responses to situational variability in climate and soil, choice of animal type and N fertilisation level within the Lake Taupo region of New Zealand. Factorial combinations of soil type (Oruanui and Waipahihi), climate (low, moderate and high rainfall), animal type (sheep, beef and dairy) and N fertilisation level (0 or 60 kg. N/ha/yr) were simulated. High rainfall climates also had colder temperatures, grew less pasture and carried fewer animals overall which lead to less dung and urinary N returned. Therefore, even though a higher proportion of N returned ultimately leached at the higher rainfall sites, the total N leached did not differ greatly between sites. Weather variation between years had a marked influence on N leaching within a site, due to the timing and magnitude of rainfall events. In this region, for these two highly permeable soil types, N applied as fertiliser had a high propensity to leach, either after being taken up by plants, grazed and returned to the soil as dung and urine, or due to direct flow through the soil profile. Soil type had a considerable effect on N leaching risk, the timing of N leaching and mean pasture production. Nitrogen leaching was greatest from beef cattle, followed by dairy and sheep with the level of leaching related to urine deposition patterns for each animal type and due to the amount of N returned to the soil as excreta. Simulation results indicate that sheep farming systems with limited fertiliser N inputs will reduce N leaching from farms in the Lake Taupo catchment. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Foehn events over the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs), the largest ice-free region of Antarctica, promote glacial melt that supports biological activity in the lakes, streams, rocks and soils. Although MDVs foehn events are known to depend upon the synoptic-scale circulation, the physical processes responsible for foehn events are unknown. A polar-optimized version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (Polar WRF) is used for a case study of a representative summer foehn event from 29 December 2006 to 1 January 2007 in order to identify and explain the MDVs foehn mechanism. Pressure differences across an elevated mountain gap upstream of the MDVs provide forcing for southerly flow into the western, upvalley entrance of the MDVs. Complex terrain over the elevated gap and the MDVs leads to mountain wave effects such as leeside acceleration, hydraulic jumps, wave breaking and critical layers. These mountain wave effects depend on the ambient (geostrophic) wind direction. Pressure-driven channelling then brings the warm, dry foehn air downvalley to eastern MDV sites. Brief easterly intrusions of maritime air into the eastern MDVs during foehn events previously have been attributed to either a sea-breeze effect in summer or local cold-pooling effects in winter. In this particular case, the easterly intrusions result from blocking effects of nearby Ross Island and the adjacent Antarctic coast. Temperature variability during the summer foehn event, which is important for meltwater production and biological activity when it exceeds 0 degree C, primarily depends on the source airmass rather than differences in foehn dynamics.},

abstract = {Efforts to improve the efficiency and efficacy of tree structure and crown architecture measurement are necessary to reduce error associated with indirect estimation of volume, which affects biophysical and ecosystem modelling, as well as resource assessment. In this short communication, we test the potential for a commercial SfM-MVS (Structure from Motion coupled with Multiple-View Stereophotogramme- try) software package, Photoscan-Professional, to accurately determine tree height, stem diameter, and eventually volume. SfM is a technique in computer vision, which calculates the 3D position of objects in a scene from a series of photographs. It uses a technique assuming that an object in a 3D scene is located on a vector between the image of the object in the camera and the object itself. The technique allows the construction of a 3D pointcloud, such as the one produced by laser technologies – terrestrial or airborne LiDAR. SfM requires no camera calibration or control points to construct an initial model. Moreover, it is a low-cost alternative to laser technologies. The second part of our method – MVS – is a visualization technique that reconstructs a 3D textured mesh of the scene from the SfM-derived pointcloud and RGB photographs. As a proof of concept, our methods were limited to two scenarios: (1) a single potted tree in a lab environment, where exact measurements could be made, and (2) two trees of different species and size in natural environments to test feasibility outside the laboratory. Precise measurements of tree height and stem diameter were compared with estimates obtained from the 3D model created using SfM-MVS. The results indicate that the SfM method is a promising – and inexpensive – alternative to ter- restrial LiDAR and 3D scanners. Tree height estimates had error of 2.59{\%}, while stem diameter estimates had error of 3.7{\%}. The MVS algorithm used in this study was developed for plan surfaces such as topog- raphy or ‘compact' objects and does not provide a representative 3D mesh for slender trees, although it works well for large stems. The authors link this disparity to the complex branching structure of trees. Future work requires (1) the development of effective automated volume reconstruction software spe- cific to trees, and (2) the validation of the wide-scale applicability of the technology, which must include trees of various size, species, and growth forms. Moreover, future testing must include more complex environments, such as heterogeneous urban sites or closed-canopy forest sites where the proximity of other features may limit the utility of the new technology.},

abstract = {An intercomparison of high-latitude precipitation characteristics from observation-based and reanalysis products is performed. In particular, the precipitation products from CloudSat provide an independent assessment to other widely used products, these being the observationally based Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP), Global Precipitation Climatology Centre, and Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) products and the ERA-Interim, Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), and National Centers for Environmental Prediction-Department of Energy Reanalysis 2 (NCEP-DOE R2) reanalyses. Seasonal and annual total precipitation in both hemispheres poleward of 55° latitude are considered in all products, and CloudSat is used to assess intensity and frequency of precipitation occurrence by phase, defined as rain, snow, or mixed phase. Furthermore, an independent estimate of snow accumulation during the cold season was calculated from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment. The intercomparison is performed for the 2007–2010 period when CloudSat was fully operational. It is found that ERA-Interim and MERRA are broadly similar, agreeing more closely with CloudSat over oceans. ERA-Interim also agrees well with CloudSat estimates of snowfall over Antarctica where total snowfall from GPCP and CloudSat is almost identical. A number of disagreements on regional or seasonal scales are identified: CMAP reports much lower ocean precipitation relative to other products, NCEP-DOE R2 reports much higher summer precipitation over Northern Hemisphere land, GPCP reports much higher snowfall over Eurasia, and CloudSat overestimates precipitation over Greenland, likely due to mischaracterization of rain and mixed-phase precipitation. These outliers are likely unrealistic for these specific regions and time periods. These estimates from observations and reanalyses provide useful insights for diagnostic assessment of precipitation products in high latitudes, quantifying the current uncertainties, improving the products, and establishing a benchmark for assessment of climate models.},

abstract = {The surface wind regime of the Ross Ice Shelf (RIS) is dominated by northward outflow influenced by drainage from both East and West Antarctica and synoptic disturbances over the Ross Sea. To quantify the effects of the wind regime on the climate of the region, we produce a synoptic climatology of the RIS and Ross Sea via a k -means clustering technique applied to surface (10 m) winds from the ERA Interim reanalysis (1979–2011). We describe the generation of the climatology and discuss composites of surface winds, mean sea-level pressure and temperature, which show a high degree of internally consistent structure and are similar to previous synoptic climatologies. While some small-scale features are not fully resolved by the reanalysis, such as the channelling of katabatic flows, we identify a high degree of coherence between clustering results and available in situ data sources, suggesting that the ERA Interim represents the region well. We find that the surface wind field of the ice shelf is highly sensitive to the strength and position of cyclonic disturbances in the Ross Sea, the presence of which can aid outflow from the continental interior. Temperature displays a high level of sensitivity to circulation conditions due to the effects of steep temperature gradients surrounding the shelf and advective heat transport. Cold temperatures on the ice shelf coincide with drainage from East Antarctica, while warmer periods coincide with West Antarctic drainage; this is particularly clear during RIS air stream (RAS) events. The warmest periods occur during southward transport from the Ross Sea. The sensitivity of temperature to the origin of flows suggests circulation changes in the region are likely to significantly impact surface climate. Analysis of the frequency of varying synoptic events and their persistence confirms RAS is a very common and persistent feature of the region.},

abstract = {Warm, dry and gusty foehn winds are frequently experienced in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs), Antarctica; however, their significance in the region's climate is unknown. Foehn events in the MDVs are caused by topographic modification of southwesterly airflow which is related to the occurrence of synoptic-scale cyclones in the Amundsen/Ross Sea region. The intra- and interannual frequency and intensity of foehn events therefore varies in response to the position and frequency of cyclones in this region that are believed to be strongly influenced by the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Here, we present a 20-year climatology of foehn winds from observational records in the MDVs. The SAM is found to significantly influence foehn wind frequency during the Antarctic summer and autumn months, whereas ENSO only holds significant correlations with winter air temperatures in the MDVs. The positive relationship between the SAM and the foehn wind regime in summer is particularly significant as foehn winds frequently cause summer temperatures to rise above 0 °C leading to extensive melt and thaw in MDVs. Foehn winds are a major climatological feature of the MDVs with their frequency and duration affecting the region's temperature records and their trends. Accordingly, analysis of the region's weather and climate records and predictions of future impacts of climate change on the MDVs is incomplete without consideration of foehn winds and their influence.

abstract = {This study evaluates the temporal variability of the Antarctic surface mass balance, approximated as precipitation minus evaporation (P - E), and Southern Ocean precipitation in five global reanalyses during 1989-2009. The datasets consist of the NCEP/U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project 2 reanalysis (NCEP-2), the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) 25-year Reanalysis (JRA-25), ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim), NASA Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Application (MERRA), and the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR). Reanalyses are known to be prone to spurious trends and inhomogeneities caused by changes in the observing system, especially in the data-sparse high southern latitudes. The period of study has seen a dramatic increase in the amount of satellite observations used for data assimilation. The large positive and statistically significant trends in mean Antarctic P - E and mean Southern Ocean precipitation in NCEP-2, JRA-25, and MERRA are found to be largely spurious. The origin of these artifacts varies between reanalyses. Notably, a precipitation jump in MERRA in the late 1990s coincides with the start of the assimilation of radiances from the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU). ERA-Interim and CFSR do not exhibit any significant trends. However, the potential impact of the assimilation of rain-affected radiances in ERA-Interim and inhomogeneities in CFSR pressure fields over Antarctica cast some doubt on the reliability of these two datasets. The authors conclude that ERA-Interim likely offers the most realistic depiction of precipitation changes in high southern latitudes during 1989-2009. The range of the trends in Antarctic P - E among the reanalyses is equivalent to 1 mm of sea level over 21 years, which highlights the improvements still needed in reanalysis simulations to better assess the contribution of Antarctica to sea level rise. Finally, this work argues for continuing cautious use of reanalysis datasets for climate change assessment.},

abstract = {Foehn winds resulting from topographic modification of airflow in the lee of mountain barriers are frequently experienced in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) of Antarctica. Strong foehn winds in the MDVs cause dramatic warming at onset and have significant effects on landscape forming processes; however, no detailed scientific investigation of foehn in the MDVs has been conducted. As a result, they are often misinterpreted as adiabatically warmed katabatic winds draining from the polar plateau. Herein observations from surface weather stations and numerical model output from the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) during foehn events in the MDVs are presented. Results show that foehn winds in the MDVs are caused by topographic modification of south-southwesterly airflow, which is channeled into the valleys from higher levels. Modeling of a winter foehn event identifies mountain wave activity similar to that associated with midlatitude foehn winds. These events are found to be caused by strong pressure gradients over the mountain ranges of the MDVs related to synoptic-scale cyclones positioned off the coast of Marie Byrd Land. Analysis of meteorological records for 2006 and 2007 finds an increase of 10{\%} in the frequency of foehn events in 2007 compared to 2006, which corresponds to stronger pressure grathents in the Ross Sea region. It is postulated that the intra- and interannual frequency and intensity of foehn events in the MDVs may therefore vary in response to the position and frequency of cyclones in the Ross Sea region.

abstract = {This study evaluates the temporal variability of the Antarctic surface mass balance, approximated as precipitation minus evaporation (P - E), and Southern Ocean precipitation in five global reanalyses during 1989-2009. The datasets consist of the NCEP/U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project 2 reanalysis (NCEP-2), the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) 25-year Reanalysis (JRA-25), ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim), NASA Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Application (MERRA), and the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR). Reanalyses are known to be prone to spurious trends and inhomogeneities caused by changes in the observing system, especially in the data-sparse high southern latitudes. The period of study has seen a dramatic increase in the amount of satellite observations used for data assimilation. The large positive and statistically significant trends in mean Antarctic P - E and mean Southern Ocean precipitation in NCEP-2, JRA-25, and MERRA are found to be largely spurious. The origin of these artifacts varies between reanalyses. Notably, a precipitation jump in MERRA in the late 1990s coincides with the start of the assimilation of radiances from the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU). ERA-Interim and CFSR do not exhibit any significant trends. However, the potential impact of the assimilation of rain-affected radiances in ERA-Interim and inhomogeneities in CFSR pressure fields over Antarctica cast some doubt on the reliability of these two datasets. The authors conclude that ERA-Interim likely offers the most realistic depiction of precipitation changes in high southern latitudes during 1989-2009. The range of the trends in Antarctic P - E among the reanalyses is equivalent to 1 mm of sea level over 21 years, which highlights the improvements still needed in reanalysis simulations to better assess the contribution of Antarctica to sea level rise. Finally, this work argues for continuing cautious use of reanalysis datasets for climate change assessment.},

abstract = {The observed acceleration of glaciers from West Antarctica into the Amundsen Sea is estimated to be contributing 6{\%} to current sea-level rise with the estimated potential to add 0.24 m to global sea level. Stronger westerly winds over the Amundsen Sea can increase the flow of relatively warm ocean water to the base of ice shelves that flow from glaciers into the Amundsen Sea. Thinning of the glaciers caused by this warming is a potentially important factor in driving the observed acceleration of glaciers. However, the climatology of winds in the region has not been extensively studied due to a lack of in situ observational long-term records. Here six different reanalysis datasets are assessed ({\{}CFSR{\}}, {\{}ERA-40{\}}, {\{}ERA-Interim{\}}, {\{}JRA-25{\}}, {\{}MERRA{\}} and {\{}NNR1){\}} to determine a best estimate of variability and change since 1979 when the widespread monitoring of the atmosphere from satellites was introduced. A comparison with independent mean sea-level pressure data from ice drifting buoys shows that {\{}ERA-Interim{\}} is clearly the most accurate at capturing the details of individual weather systems over the neighbouring Bellingshausen Sea, implying that it is also accurate over the Amundsen Sea. In terms of climatological means, the five recently-produced (after approximate to 2000) reanalysis datasets show only small differences. Decadal variations of westerly winds congruent with the observed increases in the southern annular mode ({\{}SAM){\}} index are a consistent feature across the reanalysis datasets. In particular, the strong seasonal dependence of observed trends in the {\{}SAM{\}} (i.e. significant positive trends in the summer and autumn in recent decades) is also seen in the strength of westerly winds over the Amundsen Sea. In terms of year-to-year variability, the annual mean westerly winds over the Amundsen Sea were found to be significantly correlated with the {\{}SAM{\}} in summer (r = 0.35; p0.05) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation in spring (September to November) (r = 0.41; p0.05).

abstract = {Foehn winds are a prominent feature of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) climate, and are responsible for periods of strong winds and warming. The foehn mechanism determined from a case study presented in earlier work is shown here to be robust for a set of the MDVs summer foehn events over the 1994–2009 period using output from the Polar Weather Research and Forecasting Model (Polar WRF). Gap flow south of the MDVs is evidenced by the positive relationship between the pressure gradient and near-surface wind speed along the gap. Subsequently, mountain waves are generated and result in adiabatic warming and the downward transport of warm air into the MDVs, and differences in mountain wave characteristics depend on the ambient wind direction and the degree of flow nonlinearity. Pressure-driven channelling then brings warm foehn air downvalley. Although a large range of synoptic-scale circulation patterns can drive foehn events, the warmest foehn events are typically associated with blocking highs over the Australian sector of the Southern Ocean, leading to warm air advection over continental Antarctica. The episodic nature of foehn events, and the tenuous connections between such events and interannual modes of climate variability, suggests that intraseasonal variability may be more important for determining their frequency and magnitude. The extraordinarily warm austral summer of 2001/2002 across Antarctica shows that advection of warm maritime air into the continental interior and strong flow aloft result in warm foehn conditions and significant melt for the MDVs. },

Four of six long-term station records showed strongly positive and statistically significant trends in duration of melting conditions, including a 95{\%} increase in the average annual positive degree day sum (PDD) at Faraday/Vernadsky, since 1948. A validated, threshold-based melt detection method was employed to derive detailed melt season onset, extent, and duration climatologies on the AP from enhanced resolution QSCAT data during 1999–2009. Austral summer melt on the AP was linked to regional-and synoptic-scale atmospheric variability by respectively correlating melt season onset and extent with November near-surface air temperatures and the October–January averaged index of the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode (SAM). The spatial pattern, magnitude, and interannual variability of AP melt from observations was closely reproduced by simulations of the regional model RACMO2. Local discrepancies between observations and model simulations were likely a result of the QSCAT response to, and RACMO2 treatment of, ponded surface water, and the relatively crude representation of coastal climate in the 27 km RACMO2 grid.},

The soils were sampled over a three-year period to trace the movement of lithium. On dry sites most of the added lithium remained in the soil where it had been applied, although trace amounts had moved up to 3 m laterally. On wet sites, where moisture was available from melting snow, much greater amounts of lithium had moved laterally and could be detected up to 5 m away. Thus in dry sites, typical of most of the ice-free areas of Antarctica, accidental contaminants will only move slowly over a short distance from the spill site, whereas on wet sites, the contaminants will eventually move more rapidly and be leached out to the lowest point in the drainage system.},

Annual values ranged from 3 to 50 mm water equivalent with the highest values nearest the coast and decreasing inland. A particularly strong spatial gradient exists in Taylor Valley, probably resulting from local uplift conditions at the coastal margin and valley topography that limits migration inland. More snow occurs in winter near the coast, whereas inland no seasonal pattern is discernable. This may be due, again, to local uplift conditions, which are common in winter. We find no influence of the distance to the sea ice edge. Katabatic winds play an important role in transporting snow to the valley bottoms and essentially double the precipitation. That much of the snow accumulation sublimates prior to making a hydrologic contribution underscores the notion that the McMurdo Dry Valleys are indeed an extreme polar desert.

The Antarctic surface wind cli-mate can be classified based on the Weibull shape factor k w . Very high values (k w [ 3) are found in the interior plateaus, typical of very uniform katabatic-dominated winds with high directional constancy. In the coast and all over the Antarctic Peninsula the shape factors are similar to the ones found in mid-latitudes (k w $\backslash$ 3) typical of syn-optically dominated wind climates. The Weibull shape parameter is systematically overpredicted by ERA reanal-yses. This is partly corrected by RACMO2/ANT simula-tions which introduce more wind speed variability in complex terrain areas. A significant improvement is observed in the performance of ERA-Interim over ERA-40, with an overall decrease of 14 {\%} in normalized mean absolute error. In escarpment and coastal areas, where the terrain gets rugged and katabatic winds are further inten-sified in confluence zones, ERA-Interim bias can be as high as 10 m s -1 . These large deviations are partly corrected by the regional climate model. Given that RACMO2/ANT is an independent simulation of the near-surface wind speed climate, as it is not driven by observations, it compares very well to the ERA-Interim and AWS-115 datasets.},

abstract = {?2015. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.The Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) is an area of climatologically low atmospheric pressure situated over the Southern Ocean. The depth and location of this feature have significant effects on winds, temperature, moisture transport, and sea ice in its vicinity. In this article, we quantify the modulating effect of this feature on winds over the Ross Sea and Ross Ice Shelf. We examine composites of surface winds sampled according to extrema in ASL depth, longitude, and latitude. We employ the output of a previously developed synoptic climatology to identify the explanatory synoptic-scale forcings. In autumn, winter, and spring (AWS) we find that the impact of the depth of the ASL is smaller than that of its location. The ASL moves eastward when it is deep, thereby reducing its influence on Ross Sea winds. When the ASL is northward, we find strongly enhanced southerly flows over the Ross Sea and Ice Shelf, forced by greater cyclonic activity in the north of the Ross Sea. In summer, we find increased cyclonic flow coinciding with a deeper ASL, despite the ASL being located in the Bellingshausen Sea at this time. The responses to the ASL longitude and latitude are profoundly different to those in AWS, suggesting that relationships are strongly dependent on the varying seasonal location of the low. We examine two metrics of the ASL depth and identify that the absolute mean sea level pressure (MSLP) has a more widespread response than that of the relative MSLP.},

abstract = {Foehn events over the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs), the largest ice-free region of Antarctica, promote glacial melt that supports biological activity in the lakes, streams, rocks and soils. Although MDVs foehn events are known to depend upon the synoptic-scale circulation, the physical processes responsible for foehn events are unknown. A polar-optimized version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (Polar WRF) is used for a case study of a representative summer foehn event from 29 December 2006 to 1 January 2007 in order to identify and explain the MDVs foehn mechanism. Pressure differences across an elevated mountain gap upstream of the MDVs provide forcing for southerly flow into the western, upvalley entrance of the MDVs. Complex terrain over the elevated gap and the MDVs leads to mountain wave effects such as leeside acceleration, hydraulic jumps, wave breaking and critical layers. These mountain wave effects depend on the ambient (geostrophic) wind direction. Pressure-driven channelling then brings the warm, dry foehn air downvalley to eastern MDV sites. Brief easterly intrusions of maritime air into the eastern MDVs during foehn events previously have been attributed to either a sea-breeze effect in summer or local cold-pooling effects in winter. In this particular case, the easterly intrusions result from blocking effects of nearby Ross Island and the adjacent Antarctic coast. Temperature variability during the summer foehn event, which is important for meltwater production and biological activity when it exceeds 0 degree C, primarily depends on the source airmass rather than differences in foehn dynamics.},

abstract = {Climate models predict Antarctic precipitation to increase during the 21st century, but their present day Antarctic precipitation differs. A model-independent climatology of the Antarctic precipitation characteristics, such as snowfall rates and frequency, is needed to assess the models, but it is not yet available. Satellite observations of precipitation by active sensors has been possible in the polar regions since the launch of CloudSat in 2006. Here, we use two CloudSat products to generate the first multi-year, model-independent climatology of Antarctic precipitation. The first product is used to determine the frequency and the phase of precipitation, while the second product is used to assess the snowfall rate. The mean snowfall rate from August 2006 to April 2011 is 171 mm year−1 over the Antarctic ice sheet, north of 82° S. While uncertainties on individual precipitation retrievals from CloudSat data are potentially large, the mean uncertainty should be much smaller, but cannot be easily estimated. There are no in situ measurements of Antarctic precipitation to directly assess the new climatology. However, distributions of both precipitation occurrences and rates generally agree with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim data set, the production of which is constrained by various in situ and satellite observations, but does not use any data from CloudSat. The new data set thus offers unprecedented capability to quantitatively assess Antarctic precipitation statistics and rates in climate models.},
