\section{Introduction}
New Zealand southern beech (genus \emph{Fuscospora} and \emph{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Lophozoniua}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Lophozonia}\DIFaddend }, formerly \emph{Nothofagus} \citep{Heenan2013}) forest dominates over 2 million hectares (ha) of New Zealand forest, and features in almost 2 million ha more \citep{Shepherd2005}. It comprises five species: mountain beech (\emph{Fuscospora cliffortioides}), red beech (\emph{Fuscospora fusca}), silver beech (\emph{Lophozonia menziesii}), black beech (\emph{Fuscospora solandri}), and hard beech (\emph{Fuscospora truncata}). \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{These }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend trees reproduce almost yearly, with periodic highly productive seasons known as 'mast' years that produce large volumes of seed \citep{Wardle1984}. Seed is a significant food source for a number of birds and mammals. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Rodents and
mustelids are of particular concern \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Elliott2016} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
because during }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{During }\DIFaddend mast years the rodent population increases significantly \citep{Elliott2016,Ruscoe2010}, providing an abundant food source for mustelids (esp. stoats -- \emph{Mustela erminea})\citep{King2011}. All rodent and mustelid species are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{non-native and prey on New Zealand }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{introduced to New Zealand and also prey on }\DIFaddend native bird species\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, so increases in their populations
are concerning. This compounds when the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. When }\DIFaddend seed begins to run out\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and alternative }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, increasing pressure is put on native biota as additional }\DIFaddend food sources are sought\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as populations
become unsustainable}\DIFdelend . Population control of introduced predators is essential for preserving \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{populations of }\DIFaddend native and endemic \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{species of birds}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{birds, reptiles, and invertebrates }\DIFaddend in New Zealand, especially \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{during }\DIFaddend beech mast years \citep{King2011}.

The New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC) is responsible for managing forests on public land, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as well as }\DIFdelend preserving native species\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend and coordinating pest control. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{They need to know when and where }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Prediction of the extent and intensity of }\DIFaddend significant mast events \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{occur for targeting }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is a critical component for planning }\DIFaddend pest control efforts to limit the explosion of predator populations \citep{Elliott2016}. A number of approaches are currently used for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{targeting}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{planning management interventions}\DIFaddend : (i) modelling, (ii) field observations, and (iii) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sampling of tree branches}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \emph{\DIFadd{in situ}} \DIFadd{sampling of developing seed crops in tree canopies}\DIFaddend . (i) The 'delta-T' ($\Delta{T}$) model \citep{Kelly2013} uses the difference in mean temperature from the previous two summers ($T_{n-1} - T_{n-2}$) to predict likely \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{seedfall }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{seed fall }\DIFaddend for the following autumn \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. This has been used to predict high seed yields }\DIFdelend at national scale. However, it relies on temperature data, which are currently only available on a modelled 5 x 5 km grid, so will miss smaller-scale micro-climate effects. While historical temperature is an important factor in synchronizing mast events \citep{Kelly2013}, other factors such as nutrient availability also play a role \citep{Allen2014}. New research suggests that rising temperatures due to climate change may \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{change the masting }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{alter the mast }\DIFaddend cycle of beech trees \citep{Bogdziewicz2020,Allen2014}, increasing the spatial and temporal complexity of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{masting }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{mast }\DIFaddend patterns \citep{Allen2014} and potentially \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{desynchronizing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{de-synchronizing }\DIFaddend flowering/seeding, effectively reducing the impact, and predictive power, of temperature on the timing of the reproductive cycle \citep{Bogdziewicz2021}. (ii) Field staff from DOC are well-placed to provide observations of beech flowering in certain areas as part of their normal duties. However, there are large areas of forest that remain unobserved and spatial extent is often difficult to define, especially at a regional or national scale. (iii) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Finally, extensive }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Extensive }\DIFaddend sampling campaigns are conducted during years where a heavy mast is expected using helicopters to clip upper branches from trees
so seeds can be counted. This task is expensive, labour-intensive, and dangerous. 

Remote sensing has proved to be an effective tool for monitoring vegetation phenology, particularly when a rich time series of imagery is available \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Zeng2020}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Bolton2020,Misra2020,Zeng2020,Dixon2021,Moon2021MODIS,Moon2021Multiscale}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . With sensors like \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Landsat 8 and }\DIFaddend Sentinel-2 it is possible to map phenology over millions of hectares to create national maps \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{at detailed scale (10m pixels)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in great detail \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Bolton2020,Browning2021}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . Phenological characteristics are usually derived by first fitting a curve to the time series of remote sensing data, then using either threshold-based methods, moving averages, inflection point, or time of maximum increase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Noumonvi2021}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Atkinson2012,Marcos2015,Cheng2020,Garcia2021,Noumonvi2021}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . Seasonality is usually assumed \citep{Noumonvi2021}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Vegetation indices }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{As mast events are considered a deviation from the 'median' annual cycle, it should be possible to use change detection techniques \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Asokan2019,Panuju2020} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
to identify or even predict mast seasons if identifying features are visible from above \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Marcos2015,Dixon2021,Garcia2021}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
. 
}

\DIFadd{Vegetation indices, }\DIFaddend such as the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{normalised }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend difference vegetation index (NDVI) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and the normalised difference yellow index (NDYI), }\DIFdelend are often used to differentiate flowers \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and to summarise }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{or seed pods/cones and to summarize }\DIFaddend data as one variable for analysis \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Dixon2021,Noumonvi2021}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Marcos2015,Chen2019,Dixon2021,Noumonvi2021}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
. Often, multiple indices are combined in an effort to investigate multiple physical properties. For example, a study by \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{Garcia2021} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
investigating White Spruce mast events found vegetation indices targeting moisture were more effective than the traditional color-based ones but still struggled to reliably predict masting. \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{Marcos2015} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
were more successful and used increasing EVI the winter before, along with weather data during spring, as an indicator of potential mast seasons of Mediterranean oaks. Neither study were able to find a usable signature of flowering or seed/cone production to map the mast event. \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{Dixon2021} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
and \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{Chen2019} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
both successfully used multi-scale imagery to map tree-scale flowering over landscapes, \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{Dixon2021} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
by training a random forest model with drone data from known events and \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{Chen2019} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
by developing an enhanced bloom index (EBI) from drone data and successfully translating that approach to CERES, PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and Landsat data to increase coverage.
}\DIFaddend 

In this study, we investigate \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the use of freely-available }\DIFaddend satellite remote sensing for identifying \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{large }\DIFaddend areas of significant southern beech flowering in New Zealand. We use imagery from the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2 'a' and 'b' satellites to obtain a high rate of repeat passes to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{maximise }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{maximize }\DIFaddend the chances of multiple cloud-free observations, and to produce national coverage at detailed scale. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Very little ground data on flowering are available. The irregular nature of the flowering events, and ruggedness and remoteness of much of the terrain, makes planning collection of ground data for this study difficult. }\DIFaddend As significant flowering is an \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{unusual }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{irregular }\DIFaddend phenological event, we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{identify departures of NDYI from a normal annual pattern }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{model the phenology of beech forest per-pixel and identify departures from this image-by-image during spring seasons }\DIFaddend to identify heavy beech flowering. Using this method, we produce national maps of heavy beech flowering for 5 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{different }\DIFdelend years, 2017 through \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2021. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2021, with a minimum mapping unit of 1 ha. }\DIFaddend We assess the accuracy of the method by comparison with a human operator at 1000 randomly selected sites. A national map of \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{detectable }\DIFaddend heavy beech flowering can be produced at the end of every spring to assist DOC in identifying potential \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{masting }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{mast }\DIFaddend 'hot-spots' and thus aid planning of pest control operations.

\DIFaddend \subsection{Data}
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This study uses the Copernicus Sentinel-2 Level-1C calibrated top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance values as downloaded from the ESA archives, with edges masked to remove pixels that do not contain data for every band. }\DIFaddend The Sentinel-2 satellite mission consists of two satellites - Sentinel-2a and -2b - in sun-synchronous orbits repeating every 10 days. These orbits are $180^\circ$ out-of-phase with each other, which produces a 5-day revisit period. The swath width of each pass is 290 km, with five 'passes' required to cover the mainland of New Zealand, each on a different day. Overlap between passes means that some areas of the country have a higher revisit rate. Each Sentinel-2 satellite is equipped with a multi-spectral imaging sensor capturing wavelengths from ultraviolet to short-wave infrared.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This study uses the Copernicus Sentinel-2 Level-1C calibrated top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance at the sensor as downloaded from the ESA
archives, with edges masked to remove pixels that do not contain data for every band. It covers }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Analysis uses }\DIFaddend all available Sentinel-2 data over New Zealand from 2016-09-01 to 2021-12-31, with images every 10 days before Sentinel-2b came online \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{around
}\DIFdelend 2017-07-08 and images every 5 days thereafter. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Analysis was restricted to areas of indigenous beech forest assumed as defined by EcoSat Forests \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Shepherd2005,Dymond2004,ecosatnorth,ecosatsouth}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
. }\DIFdelend A 'mega-mast' occurred during spring 2018/autumn 2019 \citep{DOC2019flowering, DOC2019}. Other years showed some small flowering events or none at all. Cloudy pixels were excluded from the temporal sequence using the methodology outlined in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFdelend \subsection{Methods}
Southern beech flowers produce a reddening of the forest canopy \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that is easily }\DIFdelend visible from the ground, especially during a significant mast season. At the 10 m pixel nominal spatial resolution of Sentinel-2, the reddening of the canopy appears to the human eye as a subtle yellowing in the 'natural color' (RGB) image as the red flowers increase the red component of a pixel but not to the point of dominating the green. Higher-wavelength image bands (and associated indices) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{were investigated but the only other band that showed a noticeable response was }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{do not respond to this flowering with the exception of }\DIFaddend Band 5 (red edge), \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{however }\DIFaddend this was also associated with 'flushes' of new foliage in late spring. 
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{The yellowing effect of the canopy is subtle in natural-color renders of Sentinel-2 imagery, as demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:rgb} (a) to (d). Sub-figures (e) to (h) feature an exaggerated 'Red' (B4) band which highlights the effect, at the expense of non-forested areas. Figure \ref{fig:rgb} covers one month of imagery in an area of overlap between orbits 29 and 72 and thus has approximately double the number of overpasses compared to other areas of the country - in this 30 day period there were 13 overpasses, resulting in 5 usable cloud-free images, 4 of which are displayed. The flowering event is just starting on October 14th (Fig. \ref{fig:rgb}(a,e)), with lower western/southern slopes in full flower 7 days later (b,f), before upper and eastern slopes are in full flower 15 days later (c,g) as the areas in (b,f) give way to fresh green foliage. Eight days later on November 13th (d,h) most of the flowering has vanished. Generally there is a two- to three-week period at most in which a cloud-free image is required to observe flowering, however there is no way of reliably knowing when this window occurs as it varies with season and location.

\DIFaddend In order to detect the yellowing associated with southern beech flowering, we apply two approaches: the calculation of a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{normalised }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend difference yellowing index (NDYI) to describe the red/green band relationship; and the modelling of this index over the time-series of the image archive to detect variations from the expected (non-flowering) state. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend The effect is subtle enough that the technique required is very sensitive to cloud and shadow contamination. Additional to the cloud masking performed above, 'invalid' pixels from the cloud mask (cloud/shadow/snow/water) were buffered by 30 pixels (300 m) and patches of 'valid' pixels smaller than 100 ha were re-classified 'invalid'. Extra spectral filtering was then used to mask remaining pixels too bright or dark to be forest (or useful): $\text{B}4_{red} < 650\text{, B}3_{green} < 900\text{, B}2_{blue} < 1000\text{, B}8_{NIR} > 1000\text{, B}4_{red} - \text{B}5_{red edge} < -1500$. The result was then further buffered by 3 pixels.

The NDYI is similar to the well-known \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{normalised }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend difference vegetation index (NDVI)\citep{Rouse1974}, using the 'red' (Band 4 ~665 +/- 15 nm) and 'green' (Band 3 ~560 +/- 18 nm) Sentinel-2 bands instead of 'near-infrared' and 'red'. It is also very similar to the green-red vegetation index (GRVI)\citep{Tucker1979,Motohka2010}, with the order of the bands merely reversed:

\begin{equation}
    NDYI = \frac{(\text{B4}_{red} - \text{B3}_{green})}{(\text{B4}_{red} + \text{B3}_{green})}
\end{equation}

The NDYI is calculated using the Level-1C TOA reflectance product re-projected to the New Zealand Transverse Mercator (NZTM) coordinate reference system (EPSG:2193) and with invalid pixels masked. As the NDYI represents the ratio of red-green, and both are affected similarly by transient atmospheric conditions, it will be negative over most areas of forest most of the time (i.e. when a pixel is 'green'), increasing to near or slightly above 0 during heavy flowering events. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{NDYI was calculated for cloud-free pixels mapped as beech in EcoSat Forests \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Shepherd2005,Dymond2004,ecosatnorth,ecosatsouth}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.
}\DIFdelend 

Substantial annual variation is present in TOA reflectance observations over forest due to climatic conditions, vegetation phenology \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(e.g. new leaves)}\DIFaddend , and sun angle. The NDYI signal visually observed during flowering is subtle enough in the context of a year of data that setting simple thresholds is inadequate to produce a reliable result. Additionally, flowering can occur at different times during the spring season, depending on latitude and altitude \citep{Wardle1984,Allen2014}. The temporal sequence of NDYI for a pixel in the Hawdon Valley (South Island, New Zealand) is shown in Figure \ref{fig:sine} as an example. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Part of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The orange line is a modelled NDYI time series unique to that pixel, using an approach similar to that used in }\DIFaddend the TMASK methodology developed for cloud detection in Landsat 8 imagery \citep{Zhu2014}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{was adapted to model the yellowing index for each pixel in areas of suspected beech
forest (orange line in Fig. \ref{fig:sine}). }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. }\DIFaddend The model uses robust regression to calculate \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{unique per-pixel ($i,j$) }\DIFaddend coefficients for sine and cosine terms for intra- (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$a_1$, $a_2$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$a_{1,i,j}$, $a_{2,i,j}$}\DIFaddend ) and inter-annual (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$a_3$, $a_4$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$a_{3,i,j}$, $a_{4,i,j}$}\DIFaddend ) variability as well as a constant term (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$c$)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$c_{i,j}$), }\DIFaddend where $x$ is the number of days since the start of the temporal sequence, $T_{yr}$ is the number of days per year, and $T_{all}$ is the number of days in the sequence:

\begin{equation}
    \text{NDYI}_{mod}\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(i,j,x) }\DIFaddend = c\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{_{i,j} }\DIFaddend + a\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{_1}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{_{1,i,j}}\DIFaddend sin(2\pi\frac{x}{T_{yr}}) + a\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{_2}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{_{2,i,j}}\DIFaddend cos(2\pi\frac{x}{T_{yr}}) + a\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{_3}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{_{3,i,j}}\DIFaddend sin(2\pi\frac{x}{T_{all}}) + a\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{_4}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{_{4,i,j}}\DIFaddend cos(2\pi\frac{x}{T_{all}})

\citep{Elliott2016} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend during the 2018 'mega mast'. This threshold was used to create 'seed' areas which were grown outwards by progressively lowering it to 0.04. The resulting 'flowering' pixels were then buffered by 2 pixels followed by a 5 x 5 majority filter then eroded by 2 pixels. 'Heavy flowering not detected' patches smaller than 1 ha \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(minimum mapping unit) }\DIFaddend were removed by re-coding as 'heavy flowering detected' or 'no data' (majority of surrounding pixels), then 'heavy flowering detected' patches smaller than 1 ha were re-coded 'heavy flowering not detected' \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to reduce small-scale noise}\DIFaddend . 

As no \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ground truth data on flowering exist, the resulting }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{reliable spatial dataset of beech flowering exists beyond occasional field reports from DOC staff, the }\DIFaddend national-scale map for the 2018 mast year was accuracy-assessed by a human operator. At 1000 randomly selected sites, 500 in "heavy flowering detected" and 500 in "heavy flowering not detected", the operator determined whether heavy flowering was observed in \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a temporal sequence of }\DIFaddend 2018 cloud-free \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{spring }\DIFdelend imagery in comparison with a median spring image (excluding 2018). \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Heavy flowering was easily observed in the temporal progression of spectral reflectance relative to the median image, especially when the spatial extent of flowering moved upward in elevation as the season progressed (using the exaggerated Red band stretch shown in Figure \ref{fig:rgb}).

\section{Results}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Spring }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Austral spring }\DIFaddend (September/October/November) of 2017 was a light flowering season for southern beech in New Zealand. This was followed by a 'mega mast' in 2018 with heavy flowering observed from the ground during spring, and corresponding heavy \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{seedfall }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{seed fall }\DIFaddend the following autumn. Maps of maximum spring \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\Delta\text{NDYI}$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \dndyi{} \DIFaddend were produced for each year of data, with results for the 2018 season shown in Figure \ref{fig:ndyinz}. Spatial patterns correspond with anecdotal reports from DOC staff based at field offices around New Zealand. There is heavy flowering throughout most of the north-western corner of the South Island, and sporadic heavy flowering in eastern Fiordland. The inset of Figure \ref{fig:ndyinz} highlights the level of detail available and shows heavy flowering on the lower slopes of the Hawdon and Poulter Valleys, dissipating as altitude increases up the valley walls (black areas are not beech forest - either alpine or riverbed in this location).

\DIFaddend Figure \ref{fig:mapts} shows the maps of heavy beech flowering as detected by the method for years 2017 through 2021. In spring 2018, much heavy beech flowering was detected in the north-west of the South Island, synonymous with a 'mega mast' \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{event }\DIFaddend in that region. In the North Island and the south-west of the South Island, some pockets of heavy flowering were detected. The following year in spring 2019 the flowering was much reduced in the north-west of the South Island, but in the North Island much heavy flowering was detected, synonymous with another "mega mast". The south-west of the South Island had pockets of heavy flowering, much the same as in 2018. In years 2020 and 2021, minimal beech flowering was detected in most areas.

\DIFaddend In the 2018 map, heavy flowering was detected in 27.6\% \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(1144382 ha) }\DIFaddend of the 4.1 million ha of beech forest in New Zealand.

In the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{remainder }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{remaining 21.2\% }\DIFaddend of the beech forest \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(878406 ha) }\DIFaddend there was no cloud-free imagery in spring to make a decision. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We assessed the accuracy of the 2018 map for heavy beech flowering. }\DIFdelend In each of the two classes, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{"}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'}\DIFaddend heavy flowering detected\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{" and "}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{' and '}\DIFaddend heavy flowering not detected\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{"}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'}\DIFaddend , we generated 500 random locations at which we compared reference data with map data. Reference data \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{was }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were }\DIFaddend determined from visual interpretation of all the cloud-free spring imagery for the year. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The "}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Table \ref{tab:confusion} shows the confusion matrix of proportions.

\section{Discussion}

We developed a method that produces a national map of heavy beech flowering from a temporal sequence of Copernicus Sentinel-2 imagery (Fig. \ref{fig:mapts}). The method detects elevated values of a yellow index, NDYI, above those normally expected in spring\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{-- a
$\Delta\text{NDYI}$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. A }\dndyi{} \DIFaddend value greater than 0.08 indicates \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{heavy flowering}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{especially heavy flowering, however these regions can be 'grown' into adjacent pixels where }\dndyi{} \DIFadd{is greater than 0.04 to better capture all heavy flowering}\DIFaddend . The elevated yellow index is caused by the production of red flowers obscuring green leaves. The national map of beech flowering may be produced at the end of spring, several months before the subsequent \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{masting }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{mast }\DIFaddend event actually occurs and seed drops to the ground. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This gives }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{It is now provided to DOC, }\DIFaddend the national agency in charge of pest control, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{DOC, several months to analyse the spatial distribution and intensity of the flowering in order to
plan the extra pest control required}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for planning additional pest control to be implemented several months later}\DIFaddend . In the 2018 spring, a nationwide beech \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{masting }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{mast }\DIFaddend event was detected and mapped by this method. A manual accuracy assessment determined the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{method to be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{heavy flowering map to have an overall accuracy of  }\DIFaddend 90\%\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{accurate against a human operator with the same imagery}\DIFdelend . The spatial distribution of beech flowering as mapped by the method was also consistent with anecdotal observations from DOC field staff.

The national map of beech flowering can be used to provide extra detail to augment the existing $\Delta{T}$ model \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Kelly2013}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , as it provides a higher spatial resolution of 10 m as opposed to 5 km. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Observations of flowering also help mitigate sources of uncertainty in the previous summer }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{It is also a map of confirmed flowering, one less degree of separation from actual seed fall than the }\DIFaddend $\Delta{T}$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that could limit seed production, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{model, as physical factors }\DIFaddend such as carbon availability and soil moisture conditions \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

There is noise in the data, primarily due to a mismatch in scales of the data, nevertheless high seed counts correspond with high maximum $\Delta\text{NDYI}$. Not all high maximum $\Delta\text{NDYI}$ values result in high seed counts, as expected, so we recommend the national map be regarded as a map of potentially high seedfall, to be confirmed later with additional information such as selected field observations.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In some areas there is a paucity of satellite observations -- even with 5 daily or better repeats, many mountainous areas of the country only receive a handful of cloud-free

Temporal analysis of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery has proved successful at detecting heavy flowering in New Zealand beech forests. To achieve this, cloud clearing had to be accurate (because the yellow index is sensitive to missed cloud) and automated (because many images are required). Automation of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{could }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cloud }\DIFaddend clearing \citep{Shepherd2020} and other processing means that beech flowering maps can be produced in a timely and cost-effective way. In future, we plan to produce a national map of heavy beech flowering at the end of each spring. This would give several months for analysis to plan the extra pest control required in autumn, improving the targeting of pest control in masting areas, and leading to better outcomes for native \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{birds}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{fauna}\DIFaddend .

\section{Conclusions}
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend This study used Sentinel-2 top-of-atmosphere (TOA) imagery to detect and map atypical yellowing associated with heavy flowering of southern beech (\emph{Fuscospora} and \emph{\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Lophozoniua}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Lophozonia}\DIFaddend }) in New Zealand over ~4.1 million ha at an unprecedented 10 m spatial resolution. This was achieved by modelling a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{normalised }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normalized }\DIFaddend difference yellowing index (NDYI) over 5 years of observations and investigating deviations from expected values during spring months (September--November). A 'threshold' \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\Delta\text{NDYI}$
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \dndyi{} \DIFaddend value of 0.08 may be used to identify areas of heavy flowering, with connected areas of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\Delta\text{NDYI}$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \dndyi{} \DIFaddend > 0.04 also likely flowering. The method has been automated and can be run for all of New Zealand in less than a day on a cluster of approximately 1000 CPU cores. Using Sentinel-2 imagery, the method typically provides information on heavy flowering for 80\% of the beech forests in New Zealand with a high \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{accuracy of over 90}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{overall classification accuracy of 90.8}\DIFaddend \%, producing \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{helpful information for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{useful information for planning }\DIFaddend national-scale pest control efforts.
